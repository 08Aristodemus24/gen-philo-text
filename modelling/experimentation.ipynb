       "'a simple idea \"what is the meaning of life?\"\\ni asked as i learned through the works of camus? \\none step down, i felt a yearning of meaning in this world.\\nin this yearning i stumbled upon eastern philosophy;\\nikigai as the japanese philosophers called it was a considerable way for me to find meaning at that certain point in my life. \\nfollowed then another idea, a leap of faith as kierkegaard would call it, yet i had no idea this was his idea. \\ncalm followed after the storm, and then i took another step down. \\nalthough i know the next idea i had was because of the idea of meaninglessness by camus, i was not sure where this exact idea started — the idea of right and wrong, good and evil. this one step down i would say was worse than the one before, as it forced me to think deeper than ever, thereby not knowingly using regression to find the answers i was seeking. if i was to be caveman, regress to a less developed state of man, a blank slate as i call it, how would i invent good and evil? writing was a way i got to express what i was thinking as the opposed action of not writing it was surely a quick way to let my idea that i thought was important slip away. writing i quickly knew how the idea of good and evil came to be, how it was birthed and willed into this world. suffering i discovered was the simple answer. man i believe by his instincts truly is afraid of suffering, at least at first i claim. and it is the infliction of pain and agony upon another man is what i believed stemmed the idea of evil, as opposed to the simple actions of affection by physical touch or compassion — as cain brought upon abel. one step down again and i confess even i questioned my own virtues, it being discipline, courage, self-respect, compassion, empathy, selflessness, in my psyche the excavations went deeper, as i thought of reasons why i had to live by these virtues — most especially courage and discipline the reason being because these we are  the hardest to take into action. a simple answer but a rather hard process i endured, \"nothing in this world was ever worth having without sacrifice and without pain\", and it is in this pain we are afraid the most that we must endure in order to achieve what was worth achieving, i said. \\nthe question i most sought to answer was why should man drive through pain?\\nhere in this time i thought it was because of happiness. \\nhow naïve of me to think this was the only reason. \\nor maybe a reason at all there wasn\\'t.\\n\\none step down another idea i learned through the creed of the assassins.\\n\"nothing is true, everything is permitted\". \\neasier said than explained, was it because of free will i asked, how man had choices, paths to walk and that was what made beliefs true but never absolute? \\nhow naïve of me for saying to myself that i will live by this forever, and yet i did not fully understand it, no, not until i went down further. \\nwhy was nothing true? in my mind i was replaying the same scenario over and over, trying to understand it. \\nif man can inflict pain upon himself similar to arduous tasks, what of being a masochist? \\nuntil this day it angers me so, that it is rather difficult to differentiate the pain of discipline from the other. \\n\\none step down, in every step i took it was beginning to break me down. \\nthe campaign i thought was over was not. \\ni was complacent and again naïve. \\nlike a disease infecting my mind with doubt, it kept knocking on my mind that there was something wrong about my beliefs — my virtues of courage and discipline most especially. \\nit started with a simple idea, what if i was the weakest man on earth? \\na man with no ideas of facing fear, driving through pain or the act of letting go of negativity. \\nthus my idea of the crucible was born. \\ni had to will this to existence, with no other reason other than my belief that this is where the virtues of courage and discipline could be born.\\ni needed an assurance that these virtues could be born…to have a genesis.\\n\\nonly now i see it that i have been too hard on man on my first account. \\ni was afraid that if there was no compelling reason, a reason like happiness or for survival then i admit that man could never have birthed these important virtues — and yet i still believed. \\na way there had to be, for man to be able to birth these virtues i thought. \\nthe crucible as i call it, an alternate hell, for man, then it hit me if man could stand and fight as opposed to staying down it is in this action that virtues can be born. \\nif man truly was a free spirit then he would and can choose to stand and fight in the midst of hell. \\nthus this was my final answer, or so i thought. \\na conclusion i was finally able to make about the creed i lived by, why nothing was true was because man  beliefs or choices could be chosen at any time, and that meant also death.\\n\\nanother step down, if choices were to not exist what of mans ability — to choose to stand?\\ni thought it was that simple, however to be the weakest man on earth, man would have to be a being without knowledge of everything that encompasses him — a blank slate as it were. \\ntherefore man must forge his own choices, his own path. \\nescape man cannot for there is no escape from suffering even in life itself, but overcome he must, and this alone only comes from forging one  own path. \\nthe choices as such can be trying to standing up, staying in despair, trying to escape inescapable suffering, asking questions so as to unlock ideas, letting go, or charging into hell itself. \\nreiterating, man must forge his own way.\\n\\nanother step down further into the pits of hell; i have never known that this campaign wasn\\'t only about searching for a foundation for my belief, and for other  beliefs for generations to come; as i write this i have realized that at the very moment i walked down this staircase was myself walking into the very gates of hell. \\nat this point in time, finding a solution was a vital way i saw, for man to overcome hell in reality itself — in the real as i called it. \\nthe concept of free will, that which i saw as a constant of this reality was even not so. \\nfor free will exists when man has choices, i think to myself what if man had none? \\nthen what could be next i am  afraid is death by man  own hand, anything to escape the suffering that man experiences. \\nfor a fact of the matter is, man has no luxury of immortality, to be able to see enlightenment in despair in the face of suffering is incredibly difficult, it is rather hard to derail a mind from the thought that he cannot bear the suffering brought upon him anymore, but then again i would argue also that when nothing is left of man but agony then he must endure rather than take his own life, because it is not so much that he wants to die it is to merely end the pain. \\na terrifying thought that i have come to realize about the concept of determinism and free will — \"to hell with it\" i said. \\neverything my mind could possibly think of that was suffering i listed, from war, to rape, to sickness, to just plain unfortunate series of tragedies, the horrors of life. \\nthe darkness of waiting torment and agony and yet does not  come was also a problem that needed to be solved. \\nmaybe it was man  fear of suffering that allowed this darkness to torment him? \\nlike fighting on two fronts it was, i needed to solve the problem of suicide, and birth idea of courage. \\n\\nthough the answer which i thought was the answer of standing and fighting in the midst of suffering i felt had missed something vital, something of importance. \\nwith the real horrors of life, i began to see that maybe it was courage all along that was the virtue i was aiming for man to learn. \\ni was seeking a way for man to somehow solve the problem that life will give him struggles, life will give him something to be afraid of. \\nand it is in this very fear that never allows man to live fully. \\ni was intrigued at the same time already weary from the constant thoughts, thus writing a second one was a necessity for me, a compilation of ideas that i owe to nietzsche is  ubermensch that i had to build upon, banded with my ideas of damnationism, and regressionism.\\n\\nhow does one become courageous i asked? \\ni merely thought it was acting in a situation where fear paralyzed man and a fact it is that fear greatly paralyzes man, and may also cause us to cower from it, and so i thought hard how man could overcome his demons. \\nwas it the will to act though paralyzed by fear? was it fighting against it? \\nwas it raging against it? and was it charging towards it? \\n\\nthinking about the idea that maybe it was about a lineage, that all along i was seeking in this journey i partook — a lineage, a genesis of man  virtue. \\nas simple as already doing difficult enough tasks for fulfillment, was enough for me to finally see that sometimes virtue can be born with a reason to compel man. \\nin the simplest of ways can courage be finally be formed in the spirit of man because to have the idea of courage is important, but to act upon it is very difficult — it is in the very act of trying, an act of just doing, a leap of faith. \\nthus the virtue of courage can be born in trying as well as discipline. \\n\\nman being a blank slate he is, man, i wholeheartedly believe can birth the idea of courage. \\na first born idea, an ancestor idea i called it because man himself willed it into existence without the reliance of society, family, or merely singular individuals that would make him derive an idea and then will it into existence. \\ni have recognized that many of my virtues are merely but descendants of its first born, cared by the host which passed on this first born idea generation after generation. \\nand while man may very well by his own hand take his own life, the truth still stands, man can will his virtues into existence be it from the observance of another individuals suffering, learning it from a teacher, and the most difficult of all — birthing his own virtues alone in any way he can, by taking a leap of faith.\\n\\nfinally it was liberating to revise \"the crucible\", as stupid of an idea as maybe most people would read, the man somehow had to have achievements. \\nby charging towards fear he would have the sword of courage, by doing what is difficult he would have shield of discipline, by finding peace and solitude amidst the chaos he would have the helmet of equanimity. \\nonly the armor of vulnerability was missing of its reason for attainability, i know not of how man could overcome pain — yet. \\nit is in that fateful moment that man tries, because it is in trying man will know he can. \\nthus tolerating fear and pain will be much easier. \\nwith trying it is engraved in our minds that we can overcome that which we think we cannot overcome because we have already done it firsthand. \\n\\n\"up until the universe comes to its epilogue\" i wrote, man  greatest purpose shall be to keep fighting in this world of suffering, and hope not of a pre-existing essence or purpose bestowed upon man by a deity or god. \\nso that in turn man may be able to live independently and to overcome the suffering of life. \\nthis is the war; the battle man shall live for every single day of his life. \\nit is in this war that man will find eternal glory. \\n\\ni was hit by nostalgia; my younger self who simply marveled at an image of what he saw as himself before; a wolf pup bleeding out from the arrow that hit it and a larger wolf with multiple arrows protruding behind its back. \\ni was struck by an idea, that maybe it was not really the virtue of courage that was of most importance, but it was the will of man to endure in difficult times. \\na memory i recalled, most prominent to me was that of finally stepping on that floor of the court i was most afraid of stepping on because of the many fears i had of much more threatening, intimidating and dangerous men. \\none in particular was that whom i feared the most. \\nit has been rather years since i never saw the likes of him, but the trauma that infected me on that fateful day me and him went against one another. \\nthe days after i was never the same, i was never the same naïve, ignorant, and joyful child ever again. i was infected with the thoughts of always this man. \\nabout maybe 2 years have gone and i was still infected by flashbacks and visions that would flood my mind that would be caused by just a mere particular kind of light source — i was filled with dread because it had reminded me of the horrors.\\n\\nlike lightning i was struck by an idea, from an image from the past. \\nall along i thought it was man  the will to act in suffering, the will to try and charge into his fears; it was the will to endure that allowed man to adapt in the hardships that he was faced with; that virtue of courage and discipline was just as important as endurance, because one cannot exist without the other. \\nrather, like siblings they depend on each other. \\nwhile the ways of standing up, fighting and doing the hard thing was discipline, facing fear was courage, and the act of letting sadness go was surrendrance, it was the will to endure that allowed man to adapt and the adaptation and strength that comes, not only of his body, but of his mind. \\nlike the test that was undertaken and had to be endured by every soldier of sparta, the agoge; i thought that every man born into this world had to strive to the best of his ability endure this agoge of life. \\nto try and forge his own path, be his own man, and be the hardened warrior that he must become in the midst of suffering.\\n\\nthough i do not believe entirely of camus\\' rejection of kierkegaard  leap of faith, i believe that this action does have its merits, because man can never know what is on the other side, and so he puts his faith into the unknown, firmly believing, god is there to be his salvation, that i believe is a necessary value for non-conformity in christian social communities. \\ni liken this as well to my idea of trying; we ask questions why do we have to face fear, or why do we have to do the hard things? \\nthere maybe is no answer i am  afraid, but all that is left to do is to just do it, to try — to take a leap of faith. \\nthe idea that virtue cannot have a reason until one has done it; and so i talk to my younger minded self, \"it was never about finding a reason why you were courageous but because you know man must try in order to know the reason to be courageous, and until then you know that there is no reason to be courageous.\"\\n\\ni too have my own description for the relationship with my own inclination to thinking. \\na love-hate relationship as i would  like to describe it. \\nhowever i believe man should be able to balance his capacity to over think and his capacity as to not thinking at all. \\nwhether it would be finding a way to stop over thinking or to stop his ignorance, it is to actively find a way that he will evolve. \\nwhen find the solution to thinking too much he too must find balance because of too much of not thinking; leading to the inability to solve problems and the emergence of ignorance. \\n\\nthough i still put my faith in god, i strive as best i can to be my own man, i know i have taken a leap of faith, and i believe that god is somewhere beyond the cosmos watching my every step and action, and always in my mind. \\ni do not have all the solutions in the overcoming of man  suffering but nevertheless man must still strive to be his best, to be stronger alone in the face of suffering and to be the hardened warrior that he was always meant to be. \\nand idea i have come to fear, is the truth i am  afraid, man in society is so quick to follow, because it is rather much easier to follow others ideas and values, calling them as your own a descendant of an idea as i call. \\nwhile there is nothing wrong with this, i truly believe mans higher calling is that of forging his own path alone. \\ni am afraid that of lower men as well, that seek to impose their own values and morals upon men that too have the potential of being a hardened being. \\nnevertheless the fact still stands man must be free in order to forge his own path, and should never be subjected under the presence of tyranny by lower men.\\n\\nif i die in the next life, all i know now is that in the next life i do not by any means care if i take my own life, maybe because i could not have the will to endure. \\nnevertheless in this next life i hope to strive to be the strongest i can be and follow the cycle of the path to a hardened warrior. \\nthis cycle, this very composition i write in this very moment, i speculate i will also go through a similar transformation with this, my timeline of thinking. \\ni am still stricken with fear that one day in the next life i may become ignorant because of what life would maybe mold me into, i am  afraid i must therefore undergo the process again of shattering all my virtues so as to be a my own man.\\n\\nanother step down this hellhole, skeptical as i always have, i began to doubt my idea of trying, a problem and to trace the source of its origin i could not yet seem to understand. \\nit has something to do i believe with the idea of pushing through one  limits through pain; it is breaking that imaginary barrier that makes man give up, most specifically in the field of running. \\ni have made it an important virtue, pushing through limits, having limitlessness, because i believe this can also be an essential part of life, most especially in times of hardships. \\nit is refusing to give up when man hits the barrier and it is by pushing beyond this barrier by moving forward and not giving up…\\noh how blind of myself not to see this, apparently as i was writing this passage i saw the answer i was seeking — that of man  capability to always push or rather keep moving forward despite his hardships which however also happens and can be applied to the means of training oneself, running as it was in my case. \\n\\nanother step down and i look at the strength of man as a fragile notion. \\nnot because i strength in it of itself can be broken but because anytime in the next life man can be weak once again. \\ni strive to write the ideas i do learn to the best of my ability, so that man can know what it is like to be weak, because it is in this weakness that he can birth the first borns of ideas — that will lead him to strength. \\n\\ni thought deeply of the idea that quitting for example in arduous tasks that take an extreme toll upon the human mind and body. \\ni thought about how man at the first sign of pain can quit or simply just seek escape from the pain. \\ni thought about my past predicaments of how i would look into what i was about to go toward — that of pain. \\nand it is in this fear that i believe that can push man, even me to cower, and break from it. \\ni ponder at where the genesis of the virtue of courage can start, right within this very moments of man  life — where he has quit. \\nperhaps it could lie in seeing and lamenting at the mistakes he thought that lead him to the action of quitting, so in mistakes man could find a way, a solution to the mistake he has made. \\nperhaps it can be deciding to face it again over and over and not just quit. \\nperhaps it can be remembering all, that one has endured, and maybe just maybe one can try to endure it again, in perhaps another aspect of life. \\nand perhaps it might just be finding the mistake that one was not able to shake himself from the fear of what was coming, and it is in this mistake that can lead one to focus more solely in that of one  surroundings and of the present. \\n\\nimperatively this weakness of man must be known, acknowledged and emphasized to the highest degree. \\nat any point in time when one knows that whether or not he has overcome an obstacle he thought he could not overcome there will always come a time that once again he will be tested, and man again may doubt, man again may do anything to stop the pain, man may again cower, man may again feel nothing but helplessness and agony, and man may very well again quit. \\nthen again it is in this willingness to try again, with or without any reason whatsoever, the willingness to give oneself another chance to move forward amidst suffering, a willingness to try and charge into that which one thinks he cannot overcome, and a willingness to endure and move forward until the end. \\nit is in this fortitude of man that allows him to birth the idea of virtues.\\n\\nreiterating, although it may seem small and insignificant to others i was at a low point when i believed even idea free will was not a constant of this reality. \\ndeath, contemplating it alongside, was what i thought of, but i do know now however, a path of suffering shall lead either to suicide or the will to endure. \\nand maybe therein lies the answer, it is to see the fact that one is still here, that one stuck long enough to endure and not take his own life. \\nit is the will to endure, the will to carry on forward. \\nit is in the idea of survival that maybe one can go through it again, though one may not voluntarily wanted to go through it nevertheless he endured, and it is in this capacity to voluntarily face it that can allow man to will the virtue of courage into existence.\\n\\ni deeply acknowledge one of the few influences of my ideas, david goggins, which i consider not only as a practitioner of his ideas but also a philosopher himself. \\nthe milestones he has achieved, and most of all the hardships he has endured i believe to consider to be unparalleled by the majority of society today. \\nwhile it can be true that all can, it is not always the case that all will, because of the insurmountable amounts of difficulty one has to drive through. \\nit is difficult to be alone, it is difficult to create your own values and morals, and moreover it is undoubtedly difficult to endure the evils of life itself. \\ni had my fair share of difficulties, and like a weak man whom i am not afraid to bear the title of, i thought i could not; i did any way i could possible to rid the ones who caused misery, fear, and anger, i hid in fear whenever i could to never see the likes of the ones i feared the most, all my life i have hid from that of which i was or whom i was afraid of. \\nand it is in these moments where man could conceive the virtues to combat and overcome all the evils of life — and in turn forge hope from this crucible. \\ni am still here, come hell or high water, to endure, i shall…until the end.\\n\\ni however do not still like the fact that i have not yet discovered what it means to truly focus in the present, i know of its benefits yes, yet i must amend i am in need of knowing its lineage — its genesis. \\nthe lineage as i thought could lie in the willingness of man to find a way, to simply identify the mistakes that he made, that of which, not able to focus in the present. \\nand maybe then through this identification, can lead man to mitigate leading himself astray from the present and shifting his focus back towards the present. \\nto lead astray from the present what does it mean? \\ni define it as to see that which is non-existent, may exist, or will exist. \\nto recognize this blinding projection of mans mind is what maybe will allow man to birth the virtue of presentfulness. \\nalthough unbeknownst to the majority of society it is in this excessive thinking of what will be or what can be, that at times cripples us, and in turn fail in those times to truly let go of this degrading habit.\\n\\nin the darkness and the unknowability of the unknown, even if the odds of individuals that do believe in the heavenly father are stacked against my idea i must confess that even i fear the notion that the god of so many could also be an agent, an entity, not of benevolence but of indifference, and therefore a means to bring about the possibility of damnation to this earth or after death.\\n\\nas i interpret nietzsche, man  faith in god is never harmful, i now see, but it is in this, so called commandments of god that blinds man from the probability that this, what he believes as so called dogma is in actuality subjective morality. \\nthe commandments of god i claim are but merely products of man  own thinking as well and it is in this creation of these morals by men before urge me to conclude that these men i consider as higher men because it is their own orals created by them and them alone, yet i ponder still however at the notion that the only disadvantage to this now advantageous \\'framework\\' of society, is the individual ceases to be.\\nman ceases to create his own thus men like him and his descendants become lazy sheep. \\nlike a herd being herded by the shepherd/s or as i like to call him nietzsche is  overman. \\na belief in a god is good in my eyes; placing one  sense of strength in him is good because it humbles oneself. \\nplacing one  sense of salvation in a benevolent god can be good because it teaches oneself to let go. \\nyet i am still conflicted with the notion that god a benevolent and divine being can also probably be an indifferent and going over the line — evil. \\nit goes in two very different paths of belief. \\ni therefore conclude that man must be his own salvation to overcome such a tyrant of a being although i shearly speculate. \\nand on the other i must conclude that though i place my faith in a benevolent entity such as the heavenly father, i nevertheless have the choice to place all my sense of strength in him, or strive still to the best of my ability place my belief in man that he can be his own salvation in the face of the world  evils. \\nor maybe being forsaken by god is truly what haunts me?\\n\\ngod does not exist as opposed to god does exist; if and only if he does exist god will either be man  salvation — or man will be his own. \\ni liken and align my ideas however to kierkegaard; it just so happens before i have ever known about his ideas i was on an expedition to find meaning in life. \\nwhat could ever be so wrong or right than take the leap of faith; i or even humanity has no sufficient evidence, nevertheless i have taken the leap, the only difference between the herd and myself, is follow not of a book but of my own ideas, reasons, and my own path. \\nmaybe i do have been self-centered; as i placed man  or rather my own ideals above god. \\nagain i confess i was afraid of the notion that my dependence of god would lead me to the possibility of god  indifference or non-existence and thus breeding weakness and nihilism. \\nbut i realize now that in this vast blankness and emptiness of human existence, man  relationship whether with or without a god has by any means nothing to do with the creation of his morals, ideas, and virtues. \\none could say i do not believe at the idea that the bible and its rules was laid down by a divine entity. \\nnevertheless strive i must, still, to the best of my ability, forge my own strength in this pit of hell. \\n\\nthere is however a middle ground i strive upon as much as i can, and i owe my created morals and virtues to the heavenly father, who i believe lead me not to these ideas but provided me with means to forge my own.\\n\\ni still am, up until now in the middle ground between having a sense of strong belief systems and doubting my belief systems. \\ni still contemplate at the notion that all my life i have quit when it times got hard i know i have, making every excuse in my power to escape that situation, whether that would be giving up in an exam and accepting my fate that i will fail, not attending that tryouts when i was supposed to, doing everything in my power to seek someone to just end the pain of judgment from others, or to ask someone to stop and control that which could not be stopped — bullying. \\ni would break every time. \\ni do not think i have ever accomplished anything with all my heart, mind, body, and soul, and even if i did, i may very well not remember. \\ni would have wanted suffer so that in time i could find my own strength and enlightenment in suffering — like david once did. \\nbut i cannot go back, and so i must make amends that i am still weak until this day. \\nit feels as, if suffering was put before me i would quit once again, and yet now through my intense training i manage to somehow push through to the best of my ability but yet even at times i shortchange myself. \\nthrough my lack of strength in the hard times of the past, of my past, i have found new ways to the best of my ability through philosophy. \\ni have known where could the genesis of virtues lie, and i have learned to use these ways of thinking i have found through constant training of the body and of the mind, and testing whether or not it works.\\ni was a quitter, in any way i could make the pain stop; as i have  said i relied on others to deliver me from the fear of judgment and the pain of judgment itself. \\ni was pushed by my father to endure the fear of judgment, because he had come too far to see me quit — without him i would have quit, because i was afraid. \\nonly when i was older did i learn to face my fear, to charge into it head on; by going to the training grounds whenever i was afraid to do so. \\ni have  quit all my life, and i promise to myself from this day until death claims me — i will never quit, i will endure in suffering, and i will charge into that which i fear the most head on.\\nwhatever it may be, that of which one fears the most, it is to charge towards it that will give one, courage. \\nto the outmost of my being i must emphasize that it is the willingness literally speaking to accept and to by any means accept being blown up by a grenade, to lose an arm, to being sick, to lose a leg, to lose an eye or being taken by death in the fires of combat — in the everyday battle of life. \\nwith all of these hardships man must endure, and in time…in time he will fulfill his destiny to become a hardened warrior.\\nit is hell that man must go through in order to forge an unbreakable spirit.\\n\\nonce you know how evil the world can be everything good in life is that much greater, full of joy and happiness and love, and much worth fighting for. \\nbut first one must first overcome the evil and suffering that life brings upon. and it is in this fateful moment that one must endure; the will to endure and keep oneself alive without giving in to the urge to kill oneself.\\nlife is inherently evil, and you have no other purpose, and so i ask you what is the essence of you having to endure more suffering? \\n\"just kill yourself to end it all\"; then again it is this suffering that man has the opportunity to create something for himself. \\nhis purpose and own meaning. thus the first obstacle is overcome — the next is to endure.\\ncarl jung put it beautifully i must say, because of his response about man  purpose and meaning, and i quote \"man cannot stand a meaningless life\". \\neven in the midst of torture, the worst actions that other human beings can bring upon you, the most evil of things — one must endure. \\nto be subjected to these actions, i can only imagine, and by merely trying to imagine the very act itself, it scares the living hell out of me.\\nmaybe weak is what i really am, maybe weak is what man is, but i keep dreaming of the day when man will be able to tolerate and overcome these evils, that this ideal of overcoming will be what men in the future will strive upon. \\nas of my present, man must overcome first the mental hardships of life, emotional and mental abuse, arduous physical training, explosives, and being a prisoner of war at the hands of sadistic humans as such. \\nman may struggle thousands if not millennia more years in vain in pursuit of greatness, but man only needeth to endure and maybe one day he who finds this power may embody this ideal, and maybe one day other men too will race behind him — they shall one day have an ideal to strive towards.\\n\\nagain nihilism rejects the possibility that there will be heaven after death, but i still cannot reconcile my belief in god and that there is no god in nihilism. \\nin addition, there will also be life  evils to accompany the ultimate meaninglessness of life. \\nthen again i must take it upon myself that there will always be two sides of the coin, either i believe in god or not, strive i must to the best of my ability to endure. \\ni do not care if this comes from god or man (myself), these virtues. \\neither this gift comes from god that i must acknowledge by believing in him until the day i die or i place faith in my own or man above the notion of god.\\n\\nyes before overcoming, it is first and foremost that one will be naïve and secondly will witness the evils of life; one may very well live in it forever and see nothing but the ultimate misery of life. \\nmeaning, the ultimate meaning of man can be created through happiness and the battle of life. \\nsimple happiness amidst the suffering and evils of life can be the most meaningful to man, playing a beautiful and emotional song with a guitar, playing the piano, listening to inspirational music, creating beautiful art are all things that make pain and suffering worth enduring in this life. \\nit is by remembering and doing things that were once of value, importance and joy to us when we were once young children, we may very well have turned our backs from it when we saw life  evils, when we were touched by the hand of malevolence and suffering. \\nwith the will to endure a vital necessity to overcome that which makes us writhe in agony a much more terrifying thought is the acceleration of wanting the ultimate escape — death. \\nbut i ask if man is of empty knowledge when he was sent to this world, a blank canvas, then how can man know of death? \\nif man does forge his own way then therefore the willingness to try and escape by death is also a part of mans hidden choices of action. \\ndeath is therefore hidden, and thus the only way is to endure. \\nin perhaps modern society, death is as vital to us man as birth. \\nthis idea of death, that has been shown to society, to us time and time again, is what gives us the idea of an escape. \\ntherefore death becomes a conscious choice — a terrifying choice.\\nthe burden then becomes heavier for man in the now present, only because of the choice that he can escape through death, anytime the toll of suffering is too much for man to endure. \\nman asks whether he has a reason to will himself to endure, because it is in this finding of a reason and eventually settling for this reason that shall give man the will to endure and overcome the horrors of life. \\nthe reason to live therefore becomes as much as a vital necessity as to the will to endure. \\n\"he who has a why to live for can bear almost any how\" a quote by friedrich nietzsche in the twilight of the idols.\\nand thus the willingness to endure will be as easy as breathing when meaning and a reason to live is present as to enduring without therein. \\nin the end of this overcoming, if man is able to create happiness in the suffering it is in this moment that truly allows man to open his eyes, to appreciate the little joys of life, to be truly an optimist in the face of suffering. \\nin this modern day and age i claim to believe that a reality which is firsthand experienced by man from birth is in fact happiness and goodness. \\nand it is from this very moment up until the hand of evil, malevolence, and suffering finally crosses our path that we ourselves may shatter our sense of everything that is good in this world. \\nput man in suffering long enough and suffering will be all that he knows. \\nnaivety is therefore broken and naivety is therefore replaced with great pessimism and despair, but because man has the ability to overcome it is in his own power to live in this sense of shattered goodness, or if he has never known goodness at all in his life, live in a sense of absent goodness. \\nhowever evil cannot exist without good and good cannot exist without evil, thus it is in mans hands again to forge his own path, to happiness. \\nit is to truly see the evil that is of this world, to overcome it, to transcend it, and finally create something of goodness out of it — an optimist not out of naivety but an optimist born out of the knowledge of great suffering.\\n\\nin a passage beautifully written by nietzsche that completely resonated with my ideas \"to those human beings who are of any concern to me i wish suffering, desolation, sickness, ill-treatment, indignities — i wish that they should not remain unfamiliar with profound self contempt, the torture of self mistrust…i have no pity for them, because i wish them the only thing that can prove today whether one is worth anything or not — that one endures.\" — friedrich nietzsche, the will to power. \\nsuch mad hope i have for man; one day, some day i hope to witness man  greatness, and if not now then maybe in the next life, and then the next and then the next.\\nthough i may not yet have read the works of nietzsche to a full extent, i do believe the ways of which man can attain this greatness through suffering, is laid out in my ideas.\\n\\nthe first step, the willingness to muster up the strength from within to leap into the darkness, to perform a leap of faith, this is faith — this is courage. \\nthough most christians would undoubtedly disagree with most of my ideas about god, wholeheartedly i believe that it is by opening one  eyes to these terrifying possibilities that allows man to embrace his faith courageously. \\ni acknowledge nietzsche and kierkegaard greatly as my main influences into creating that of what i call a true believer of god, a true worshipper of god, and a man of faith — a soldier of god.\\nwhat is a man of faith, a soldier of god truly? \\n\"man is something that shall be overcome. \\nman is a rope tied between beast and overman — a rope over an abyss. \\nwhat is great in man is that he is a bridge and not an end.\" — friedrich nietzsche. \\nlike the bridge between the overman and beast, this bridge or rather a spectrum in my eyes is represented as mans faith in god. \\nit too represents the individuality of man and most especially his will to overcome — whether weak or strong. \\nnot yet fully built but these objective traits i define as embodied by a soldier of god will be an ideal that man must strive upon, up until the epilogue of the universe.\\n\\nit shall be so that man will evolve and endure any kind of suffering literal or metaphoric, like no other. \\nmalevolent, morbid, horrifying, and evil — this is the world. \\nit lurks in every corner, waiting, watching. \\nin the moment of mans birth he is sentenced to this horrific and wretched earth until death or until death by his own hand. \\nways, so many ways to spiral down into despair and suicide, madness and psychosis or terrifyingly even the embodiment of the harbinger of darkness, wrath and destruction itself.\\nhow easy it is to choose the path of escape such as suicide, how easy it is to be consumed by madness from the suffering, and how easy it is to become an agent of chaos and vengeance. \\nin my own practice it is in my observation that not knowing when the suffering of training would end drove me to what i call short term madness, i must admit. \\nit is this unknowability, this expectation and hope that this will end and yet it does not that drives man i believe to frustration and of the destruction of his expectation of a feeling other than suffering. \\nhowever i have discovered that this madness does i believe transform into a will, a will that man can…yes accept that he has nothing whatsoever to look forward to — he is forced to shift his focus not of what might \"never\" come which is the feeling other than suffering, but on his will to endure. \\nthe mind looks for an escape and this escape can take shape in the form of false hope and it is by the destruction of this false hope that forces man to overcome that which is in front of him — a mind with no way out.\\ni must admit that i never did previously have the courage to write that, yes man will have negative reactions when it comes to suffering, but i am  afraid not all things start with goodness. \\nnow armed with the readiness that comes with enduring, man must take it upon himself to overcome and by overcome like christ once did before us, we must in turn carry our own crosses — and indeed we shall…we shall become soldiers of god.\\nthis is man. \\nthis is the genesis of mans journey…his embarkation on the greatest crusade he will ever partake — to will himself greatness.\\n\\ni must apologize for the unorganized yet peculiarly beautiful mess of my thoughts. \\ni was asleep; my eyes were closed like most others are up until now. \\nfor i did not think to look where i needed to look into the most, i thank myself for doing so now. \\npurely because it was not in my cards to die knowing i never faced what i needed to face or to die never knowing how to overcome these possibilities if i was to be born in another life. \\ni would  rather know that god left me than not know at all.\\nyes i have stated before about the possibility that god may not exist and so man must take it upon himself to strive to the best of his ability to overcome. \\nit is this period in time i must confess deeply, that i was arrogant, prideful, and most of all just afraid. i was afraid of him not existing, i was afraid that in the end there was nothing to expect, and i was afraid that in the end there was only more suffering to live for. \\nwhat was the option now if i, man, had nothing to expect? \\nthere were only three ways it could go wrong and only one where it could go right. \\nbecause i was raised in a household, which upheld the principles of christianity firmly, to deviate from it i must conclude that without question i knew i was going to be questioned for it. \\nthis is a realization that man must face…a possibility that he has to face rather than the much regrettable expense of living in blissful ignorance — it is to face what is difficult, and what is difficult is the absence of god as mans salvation.\\n\\ni rather liken my idea to that of sartre, his idea that man is born of without essence or a blank slate as such, to my idea, a pessimistic idea as i see it, that man must be a blank slate in order to truly overcome this state of his — a state of weakness, with no sense of strength whatsoever. \\nwhat lead me to the idea of such metaphysical magnitude you ask? \\ni was simply afraid of the fact that what if tomorrow or the next day, my sense of overcoming…my strength of character was gone? — was taken? \\ni was frightened by this idea and so this is what became of this journey, and what it has continually become.\\nand so i have meticulously observed it is rather much difficult to have a belief in god than to never have even the knowledge that such a god or entity exists. \\nthe latter is connected to the idea of man as a blank slate, of course hypothetically speaking a man who knows nothing, knows nothing about a belief in such an entity or a god. \\nhowever it is man himself who must discover god, and god in mans mind is born i believe in the belief of the unknown — to put faith in the unknown, which is far beyond, and lies outside the vastness of the cosmos. \\nwith man now having conceived the idea of god the stage is therefore set for nihilism, a stage in which the idea of god can be crushed in the difficulty of nothingness on the other side, with no expectation, with no comfort that man had once had had god existed, and with nothing to look forward to but death. \\nto have this in our mind, may be difficult but it is to overcome most especially the difficulty when one has built upon the pillars or the axioms of christianity from which stemmed in a simple belief in the unknown. \\nthe collapse of beliefs is what is difficult, and the possibility of god existing slowly fades should one truly let go of the idea. \\nthen again as a devout christian, with the possibility that god may not exist i have theorized of 4 ways in which i think man can respond with, in the obliteration of the idea of god, most undeniably amidst the horrors of suffering where man repeatedly calls for god the most to alleviate the immense burden he bears. \\n\\ni see now, what my arrogance has been born out of…born only out of fear, which brought thoughts of pessimism, and most of all arrogance. \\nand i see now i can both have my will to overcome and my faith in god. \\ni know action lies only within man, however now i have discovered yet another trait which is to put our faith in man  strength…in ours or in god  given strength, this is a trait nevertheless under the trait of the will to overcome. \\nand again this was the arrogance i had for i put my faith in my own strength and not in god. \\nyes i did have my faith in god but yet i had still the sliver of arrogance and pride that before i think i could not seem to let go. \\nin terms of faith, i could not have been happier and at peace with myself, than putting all my faith in god. \\ni am thankful for the dark times of questioning for without it the idea of the crucible of life would not have ever grown into the idea has now, the idea of how god can play out in the life of man. \\nit made me doubt, it shattered my faith, i could not turn away from an unanswered question…and so now i have answered it, it has been a journey, but nevertheless the journey does not end here — \"god i have doubted you yet my doubt did nothing but reinforce my belief in you…may your will be done.\"\\n\\nin some sense these \"shackles\" of mine still exist but if i was going to look into myself the only reason why i felt bitter towards i am  afraid, my parents, was because they were trying to i believe force down their beliefs down my throat to be frank. \\npsychologically speaking i believe more often than not we respond with contempt towards anyone who does this act, call it what you may; the giving of advice or the imposing of beliefs; and even the beliefs they force upon us, though we have adopted or even attempt to adopt this belief the contempt we feel more often than not spills over to these beliefs because i believe it is associated to the individual we feel this intense emotion toward — like a virus, it does have its dangers, spreading to every belief and idea we have associated with them even if these beliefs were something we wanted or choose to adopt. \\nbut looking in myself and asking myself if this were really the belief i wanted to adopt, the answer is in fact a yes, and therefore the answer is a genuine answer.\\nthus it is important to follow the conditions in which one would really want to adopt, follow, or want a belief, moral, or idea — this my friends is to truly live genuinely.\\n\\nunderstanding nietzsche i do have to confess now that my claims of his ideal way to becoming an ubermensch seemed too farfetched. \\ni do have to extend my apologies to nietzsche for being an arrogant prick. \\nnevertheless it is easier said than done and i do believe there are individuals who do struggle to shake the shackles of the herd because of fear of judgment or out of the need of acceptance and approval or out of wanting the path of least resistance, i, up until now even struggle to sever these shackles of fear and the need for acceptance, i up until now still have parts of my mask that are inauthentic to my true self. \\nthis i believe to be the precursor to my idea of strong individualism. \\nwhile nietzsche is  ideas do allow the use of other people  ideas and integrate it as one  own, it is if and only if one wants to follow these ideas, not out of the fear of judgment, not out of need for acceptance, and most especially not out of the want of convenience when clearly one  mind, heart and soul is not aligned with that of his choices. \\nthe path of least resistance is always present and treaded by almost everyone, but it is also often the path with the most resistance that is least treaded by almost everyone. \\nso i ask you directly what do you want? is it fear that which stops you? \\nwhy virtue is so important is because as nietzsche said, in order to live truly as oneself it is to live dangerously, and to live dangerously it is to say yes to every obstacle, challenge, or simply face that which one fears the most — hence courage must be therefore present in all walks of life.\\ni on the other hand had a much radical or rather idealistic idea; that man himself is to rely only on the person none other than himself and only himself. \\nhow arrogant is it not? \\nthen again i would argue that this is to prevent man from ever thinking of the possibility that he could have taken death as his only escape without those who lent a helping hand, this was again i am  afraid born out of a fear of the possibility that there was no one but myself who would be my deliverance from what i was suffering from — and so birthed this radical idea…then again i ask myself, what would i have done if i was alone?\\nthis undeniably a much difficult endeavor.\\nit is for man to affirm to himself that he himself was the key to his own salvation, not the derivation of ideas from other individuals and most certainly not from the taught and provided ideas of others. \\nwhile it does have unrealistic scenarios it is this i believe what will make man to be that, who he is truly destined to be — to be the strongest he can be.\\n\\nat the surface level it is to follow that which other want is what is called as herd mentality, and it is to choose what you want without the interference of others opinion is truly what you want, because you want it — even morality.\\nat the deeper level it is to birth your own ideas, know the higher reason and the genesis of these ideas that is the ultimate man a man can be. \\nin nietzsche is  idea as i have interpreted it, it is to destroy, the idea that which has clung unto man, which he follows inauthentically, it is to choose his own morality and know its reason to why follow such a moral. \\nin my own deeper way moreover to the fact of disregarding that which you think leads to the inauthentic being of yourself, might i add that severing of connection to society, family and friends is also a part of this revaluation. \\nnot in the context of literal distancing, and emotional unavailability but it is to know the reason that which you chose to adapt as your morals that in turn came from others and not to blindly follow. \\nit is also by definition to know its genesis, and if possible strive to birth one  own ideas, morals, and virtues. \\n\\nthe belief of god has nothing to do with man  brokenness of his morals and its destruction because of the possibility that god may or may not exist — it is only courageous faith that is needed to believe in such a god, then again with morals infected with doubt one has to reevaluate each moral that man lives by, that is, one has to know that even this dogma of christianity had been in turn made my men, and thus exclusive only for them not of others. \\ncreating one  own will be a difficult endeavor for one will have to enter a new field, a new arena, a new realm — the realm of philosophy and the practice of questioning everything. \\nthis i believe what nietzsche called for…the revaluation of all values.\\nwith a lot of introspection i believe that there are certain words said by another one could contemplate upon, this is where i believe the seed of doubt can easily grow into a disease once sown in the mind of the receiver through the process of inception.\\nsimple ideas or words heard from an influencer can easily grow like a disease. \\nideas relating to strong objections on the existence of god, the claims of others about the non-existence of god, and even the claims or rather beliefs of others that the dogma of christianity was in actuality not of a dogmatic or a doctrine from a divine entity but rather a creation none other than man himself\\ndoubt will creep in and man will have to raise questions whether the commandments of god were real. \\nthus the destruction of beliefs is at hand, and man would have to go through an experience as i had once done. \\nhe will most likely question who he is, the virtues he has that constitutes who he is, virtues such as courage, discipline, and fortitude. \\nas the destructive effects of doubt take place even on established beliefs such as, as i mentioned the self and what virtues the self acts out on a daily basis — what you act out on a daily basis. \\nhence the search for the genesis of these virtues can take place, for the mind…will seek for you will seek to find a stable belief in which you or one can feel at peace, knowing where your virtues can start.\\n\\nmaybe i am saying this because of the fact that i have overcome my fear of judgment for not following others, but i know there are others out there who have not. if i were to walk in another man  shoes whom which follows the opinion of others, follows believe what everyone believes, and want what everyone wants, maybe indeed would i have the same fear of what i once had for the consequence of judgment had i not followed these individuals ways. \\nthere is a difference however in thinking for yourself and thinking that this what you follow from others is what you really want and choose, as to not thinking for yourself and thinking that this is what you want when in actuality, you are lying to oneself just to please everyone around you. the reason for blindly following is not as simple as just blindly following but it has underlying reasons, a fear that burdens man to follow others for the sake of avoidance of judgment.\\n\\none of the many ironies of what i write is for man to forge his own path. \\nwhat i ask of man is to not follow what i think of, and yet i ask man to forge his own path. \\nwhat must man do? \\nshould he follow others? \\nquite the contrary i believe. \\nshould he follow my own developed system? \\nagain quite the contrary!\\neither way whether he follows or does not follow, but follows this ability to not follow; man runs into the same problem. \\nthe only solution is to want to follow or to want to do not  do not  follow.\\n\\nmaybe my fear of nietzsche criticizing my views and beliefs was all along he meant of the idea of blindly following just for the approval of others…changing your ideas for the sake of others — though ironically dead i was fearful for his judgment for my ideas. \\ni tried hard to understand his ideas and strived to align my ideas with his, yet it nevertheless gave me newer perspectives and ideas that influenced the creation of my ideas as well. \\nthough he and i might have similar ideas, i was afraid that some of his would not align mine.\\nanother  idea may lead to the rearranging your own ideas because of the seed of doubt that an idea might be better than your own\\nthough i have the fear of it being criticized it is in my power to decide whether to adjust or at most change my ideas or never change my ideas for others. \\nat the same time however one must listen and keep an open mind to the best of his ability; \\n\\ndoing something over and over and over is called purpose, is it really?\\nbecause it makes me happy? \\nbut then i ask what can be man  purpose other than happiness? something grand? playing an instrument day in and day out? running? fighting? celebrating christmas? overcoming that which we fear the most? \\nis it only happiness that gives life purpose? i indeed believe otherwise. \\nshould one look at it closely everything is pointless because life ends in death if one should tread the path of nihilism, should one examine that there is no suffering and only happiness in one  life, then happiness becomes not more happiness but happiness becomes that of suffering itself. \\ncontrary to popular belief it is not hedonism that provides meaning but what makes life meaningful; it is the sweet and little joys we consciously experience when we have overcome the sufferings of our life. \\nand it is this continual endless overcoming of whatever suffering life throws at our way that will give man…give us meaning.\\n\\nwith everything that is  happened i think my true purpose is to leave my legacy, and my dream of man to finally evolve, overcome suffering, birth virtue, face the cycle of finding a way to overcome suffering, and to find and create happiness amidst suffering.\\none could say i love man so much that i am willing to face hell, so as to create an ideal that man can strive upon. \\ni want to believe that every man in this earth can do it. \\nin turn i write this so as to show every man that if an idea has a genesis then surely every man in this earth can allow this genesis to occur — to birth virtue. \\nwhat is great in man, in anyone is that anyone can birth an idea, an idea to help man overcome that which he thinks he cannot overcome.\\n\\nthe virtue of limitlessness can also start for instance from trying to do something, failing because you gave up like, untying a knot underwater and panicking. \\nyou will fail over and over and it is  in one of these failures over and over that you start to decide and think where exactly you went wrong. \\nmaybe you panicked? and maybe next time you take the time to not panic and endure the pain.\\n\\nwhy be a pessimist you ask? what is pessimism? who is a pessimist? rather it is simple, it is he who has witnessed horror, it is he who has witnessed darkness, it is he who has witnessed particularly the most unimaginable, draconian and maniacal evil that has been done by man to another man. \\nhow does man overcome this great evil? then again it is in this lack of will which urges man to see nothing only but the negativity of life — pessimism as it is. \\nthe negativity of life; weakness as such itself, contains the genesis…the birthplace of actions either suicide, madness, or a strength like no other; embracing the difficulty of you yourself being the weakest man on earth. \\nthe absence of god itself in speculation births the independence and strength of man, a leap of faith or may very well a cause a disease of doubt or i am  afraid suicide. \\nand the event of facing absolute evil coupled with your own, as dark as it may seem, i have only hope that from this filth it births the restoration of man  hope in good in humanity, the awakening of his courage to face evil…to endure evil, coupled with all other virtues that can fight against evil, and the most difficult — the confrontation and overcoming of man  own evil from within. \\nand i am  afraid like all good things that are born out of tremendous amounts of adversity there shall always be its opposition…the bad; to gaze in the face of absolute horror alone can lead to suicide, and sometimes it indeed does end there for man. \\nbut sometimes man can take a downhill path, a much darker path — the path towards evil…the path of vengeance…the joining of the tide of evil itself.\\nbut then again the most important question is to be asked is, why be a pessimist? why not be naïve? why see negativity? what is it about seeing negativity that is better than being naïve? is it because negativity is difficult and naivety is easy and withstanding that which is difficult somehow makes the difficult life we live just as livable as to that which is easy? yes, indeed. \\nthe answer is rather simple and yet unfortunately, it is the most difficult endeavor to undertake.\\n\\nnaivety; never knowing, that anywhere, anything…anyone can and will show you the most horrific and darkest parts of reality, two of them being the suffering that comes with tragedy and the other being the most difficult to withstand — the face of absolute evil.\\nas for the second phase of understanding reality indeed it is better to see the worst possible scenario and learn to overcome this possible predicament. \\nhowever with every situation comes a reaction or rather an action that reacts to a situation. \\na pessimist would see all the negative possibilities on how man can act in such a situation and would conclude that, that therein is the culmination to addressing the situation…a situation where a better alternative is non-existent — pessimism as it is.\\n\\nsuicide, madness, or becoming an agent of death and destruction; what is beyond such bleak choices of man in the face of difficulty? upon the birth, the arrival on earth…the advent of man, he is but a blank slate. \\nin the present where suicide is a known choice, this is one of the difficult predicaments of man; it is undoubtedly difficult for man to reject this choice. \\nhowever in my strong faith, does it not exist for man to have a better choice other than death or acts of meaningless evil? \\ni must exclaim that, a better alternative does indeed exist! — virtue.\\nwhile everything has a beginning even virtue, everything, every action is impossible until it is done and therefore made possible, thus when an action of courage is done, the action of courage is therefore conceived. \\nthe action to endure is done and thus the action of fortitude is therefore conceived; a better choice that was once impossible and hence made possible only by taking a step, only by taking an action…only by taking a leap of faith.\\n\\ntrue optimism…what is true optimism? \\nin the face of tremendous adversity it is the will to overcome that will lead to salvation. \\ntherefore what was once a bleak and dark reality can now be seen not as suffering but as a way to overcome what is difficult…to live a life knowing one stood firm in the fight — optimism at it is. \\npessimism can be the cure for naivety but precisely the will to overcome can reward man that of true optimism.\\n\\nyou have this belief as nietzsche pointed out that you do this in the name of equality, that you rise up against those you deem a deviant of your movement, i must exclaim that you are afraid. \\ni treaded my own path of the unknown courageously because i wanted to, and i did not want to follow others because it was convenient, the need of acceptance, or out of fear. \\nfollow your own, should you want to follow even if the path is easy and convenient so be it, should you want to do otherwise, your reason being because you want to try the harder path…the lonely path — then so be it.\\n\\ni have recently starred at this mortifying abyss yet again, and i found that the harder i contemplated and dwelt at the uselessness of life and its eventual death, the more i saw how pointless my life and all its happiness was. \\nit was by the mere blink of an eye that life and all its joys could be taken away, that i have no control whatsoever with the notion of death. \\nbreaking record after record was happiness in my eyes, being competent and better to the best of my ability every single day that i woke up brought joy. \\nand i realize now however that these things could be taken away in a mere whim. \\nhow does one overcome this? for the exact answer…i am not yet certain. \\ni do know that one must accept death and face it courageously, but most of all the fear of death rooted with losing the things that were of value to us must be let go. \\nit is to courageously say we have fought the good fight, we have done everything, it is time to let go — and be grateful for all that has happened.\\nshould one spiral down this hole, they will find nothing but death, pointlessness and meaninglessness of life. \\none might i am  afraid even consider or worse do the act of dying voluntarily. \\nbut there are good things in life as well as also the bad. \\nindeed, the happiness can be taken away in a mere whim, but it is to live life to the fullest, and in the end accepting death as well as letting go the things we hold dear that possibly might give us the meaning that we all seek.\\n\\nwhat is meant by angst or the dizziness of freedom? a rather radical idea of it, i have — a visualization. \\npicture a field, this field has many ways and roads or rather paths to tread upon. \\nin one path it appeals to you because it is filled with pleasure and all great things, on the other it is filled with pleasure as well as well as all great things, and the last lets imagine is also filled with pleasure as well as all great things. \\nthe problem is not what lies ahead in a path but precisely it is because one path is only path one has to choose.\\n\\nshould man be put in this predicament of making one decision the internal dialogue may be along the lines of: \"if i pick this then i will never see the light of day of the other two\". \\nthe fear of regret that comes with picking one is angst or as kierkegaard called it — \"the dizziness of freedom\"\\n\\na peculiar but of outmost importance, i seek to find the genesis of ideas that are of most value to me the \"how\" of how an idea can come to be will be the bridge that represents the psychological processes and aspect towards the genesis of this idea.\\nthough i am  afraid i only have theories on how an idea can come to be, what i do know as of now is that the idea exists, most importantly ideas that embody virtue, and the undeniable suffering of life gives birth to such. \\ntherefore what exists between suffering and ideas, a bridge, must also represent a process, a system in which how these ideas can come to be. \\n\\nin mans lifetime, in mans existence here on earth, in mans greatest crusade. \\na number of ideas man must strive to conceive before he himself finally returns to the dust or maybe…pass from this world into another. \\ncourage, endurance, discipline, transcendence, faith, pessimism, optimism, free will, and the very idea of searching for the genesis of an idea; the striving to conceive all of which will be a difficult endeavor for man…nevertheless what is but a difficult endeavor shall be possible through mans will\\nwhile the conceiving of ideas is one of the many missions…endeavors of man. \\ni myself seek the answers to where and how each idea  genesis may lie and come about. \\ni seek to find where and how courage lies and comes about, endurance, discipline, pessimism, and optimism as such i must find where and how these lie and come about — the psychological bridge that represents the thought process of how these ideas can come to be.\\n\\non christianity moreover, i do had to ask this question to myself; what aspects of christianity have i not appreciated ever since my advent and the introduction by my parents to the doctrines and practices of christianity and the church? \\nso long i have only followed only my parents in these acts of the mass, but because i have opened my mind to what i really want i would much rather be honest with myself and proudly say i reject this way of conducting this highest form of prayer — mass. \\nthen again i myself have another question i had to ask myself; do i just be lazy or use this pain of boredom as a way to just strengthen the mind?\\ni reject this notion of inauthenticity truly because a true follower of god would not have this inauthentic doing of this action of attending prayer just because someone said so, and doing otherwise would lead to the judgment of said individual. \\nnietzsche would be right in my eyes to reform this way of prayer into that of entertainment so as to therefore lead individuals to authentically worship christ. \\nthen again if one truly worshipped christ maybe it would seem to not matter that much if prayer was either boring, or grandiose.\\n\\nwhat i am afraid of is being ignorant. \\ni ask how does one not become ignorant? \\ni do agree to what the existentialist  main ideas were such as the courageousness one has to have in order to be truly authentic to oneself, which ties in with my ideas on following and not following. \\nbut the most important question i seek to answer is that in spite of this authenticity of following or not following an ideology, habit or belief, there will be risks to it such as ignorance about a dangerous ideology and its possible pernicious effects to one  self; is it to become skeptical towards any ideology you gravitate to that may combat this ignorance?\\n\\nthen again with my fear of ignorance, i came to approach this notion like the idea that having weakness as opposed to having strength required a much greater effort to overcome and so therefore if we could in fact overcome this difficulty of overcoming an obstacle with weakness a part of you then what of overcoming an obstacle with the strength you may now have — much more bearable i would say.\\n\\nor maybe no instead of comparing ignorance as something that is overcome i would say this may be even comparable to the notion of one  capability and capacity for malevolence and evil. \\nlike ignorance, evil cannot be undone once it is undertaken but one who has undertaken this path can undoubtedly i believe redeemed. \\none has a choice…to be an agent of chaos, or to take up the cross of christ and overcome. \\ntake ignorance, out of agreement man will gravitate towards an ideology, make the conscious choice of ignorance without understanding it fully and being skeptical, or choose the difficult route to thinking about this ideology or belief deeply and being skeptical about it. \\ncomparing it with the likes of the choice of malevolence, like ignorance it is an easy path, however it is to tread the path that of difficulty that is usually the most viable of solutions. \\nto be skeptical, never to take or see an ideology or belief face value but to see the underlying notions and ideas it is built upon. \\nby no means this task is comfortable nor easy, it is a constant habit i may which compare lightly to the arduous endeavor of overcoming suffering through responsibility or what as i like to call it…the action of carrying the cross of christ.\\n\\nin part of my manuscript essays i wrote about how man can possibly degenerate into a slave. \\nto my knowledge it is a fact that i have yet to know the psychological bridge that leads to the birth of the idea of freedom for i believe that if man is put long enough in tyranny without any knowledge whatsoever about even the notion of freedom, then man will therefore cease to be the very being he was always destined for — a being of authenticity…a being of greatness. \\ni seek how the notion of freedom in this difficult predicament of man can still be birthed.\\n\\ni fear that one day man may never again forge his own path, i fear that one day he will be birthed into this world where conformity is deemed by the masses as the way, the righteous way. \\nin time the very idea of forging ones path shall fade, generations may pass that this very idea shall perish along with its entire host  that carry these predecessors…ancestor ideas, who have lived as shepherds for their ideas. \\nwholeheartedly i put my faith nevertheless, though man may live in this absolute darkness of slavery, tyranny and conformity, he is undoubtedly still capable of birthing the idea of forging one  own path lest he will learn to look within himself and question his existence. \\nhe will have to follow a path that i believe will severe all his connections from society — even his family, friends and all who have  influenced him. \\nonce man has birthed this idea it shall be the first born since its fall.\\n\\nof course non-conformity can also have its disadvantages, that being blindly non-conforming just for the sake of rejecting the idea of conformity. \\nwhile non-conformity is not at all a disadvantageous path one must know why he must not conform to the rules which society upheld for them. \\nconforming blindly is just as equal as non-conforming blindly. \\ntherefore one must either know the reason why he must uphold and conform to certain belief, or why he must not uphold and not conform to a certain belief. \\nthis is where man must find at least the reason of an idea or belief or better yet its lineage and its reason. \\ni will reiterate man must allow himself to forge his own path.\\n\\nhere you are now and imagine you are an agent of chaos, a nazi for instance, a harrower of hell. \\nit frightens you straight to your soul and so you must think that if you were born into someone else that someone else must birth the idea that you yourself are thinking of right now, which is to imagine yourself as a harrower of hell and to imagine yourself being born in another person and that person must then must imagine himself a harrower of hell. \\nthus the cycle goes on and on. \\n\\nit is a given of man to have tremendous difficulty in resisting temptation. \\ngreed most of all and moreover in the context of leadership too often than not it is mans temptation towards power, a thirst for power, his greed for power that leads to the degeneration of the society he leads to tyranny. \\nby the virtue of discipline, temptation will be its adversary — the temptation towards power. \\nand only through the righteousness of discipline can tyranny be prevented. \\nshould man presented with temptation, i ask can man do the righteous choice, of choosing discipline over temptation…the exploitation of the downtrodden? — men, women and children who do not know more than to be afraid or to live in an inauthentic life because of fear. \\nwhile this is a way, for man to prove his good will, it is not i am afraid in the interest of others to do such an act — as bleak as it may seem we are in fact few. \\nthe downtrodden cannot live simply in an inauthentic life, a life driven by fear. \\nfor there will always be those who will happily choose the path of greed, the path of happily exploiting others over the righteous path. \\n\"walang mang aalipin kung walang magpapaalipin\" — dr. jose p. rizal. \\nin an ideal world all men must need to live by the righteous virtue of discipline and man as well must live a courageous authentic life if he is to say no what others may impose on him though in this world man has enough discipline to not exploit others fear. \\nthen again i may contradict myself since there is no need for man to be authentic and have the need to say no, because of the fact that man lives by the righteous virtue of discipline.\\n\\nfrom totalitarian, autocratic, tyrannical individuals who want nothing but the obliteration of freedom of others, to the most barbaric and most unspeakable acts of evil done by man. \\nman is to be feared, man is the only creature capable of such horrific acts. \\n\\nit is to face that you will go with and for the tide of the forces of evil. \\nas dark as it may seem to harness this evil, and use it for good, it is by far yet the only way, i am  afraid to combat the tides of the forces of evil\\n\\nevil will go to great lengths and this ability to imagine what evil can be truly capable of and to see all of its most horrific elements and maybe using goodness as its mask to really bury the idea deep within someone  mind that even good can be evil and these are example of what evil is actually capable of. \\nand because you have this knowledge of what evil does and what great lengths it has to undertake to fulfill its horrific acts you can sense if anyone is trying to undertake this very act.\\n\\na harmless person is a naive person who has never known any acts evil for imagining it at the least may be horrific and frightening for him. \\ni ask also why a person as such who has no imagination for this kind of evil defenseless against this kind of evil. \\nsimple answer or rather solution be a good man because a good man will go to great lengths to imagine as much evil as possible and imagine the worst it can do. \\n\\nin my belief a good man can be aware and fight against it, or be aware and have the willingness to really have this evil undertake its horrific acts upon you to look at its face that has turned from sadistic to horrified, because it cannot hurt you anymore and you know you have waited for it the entire time, and you know what it was going to do the whole time. this is the weapon against evil…to laugh at it maniacally, to laugh at it defiantly and to let it know — that it has failed.\\n\\nhow idiotic i think of people when they themselves are unaware of the evil that skulks about in this earth as well as within them. \\nwhile most people realistically have certain knowledge of evil, and how it operates, i admit i deeply shake my head in disbelief, for most individuals perception or knowledge of evil is so shallow that should they gaze into the face of absolute evil they shall never think about evil the same way again for it shall be the most horrifying event imaginable — an event that may leave our soul broken…in great fear.\\n\\n\"what then is real evil? how does real evil act?\" they may naively ask. \\ni tell you all starting by the fact that we have been told a lie as kids that we so gladly believed. \\nwe may have even went as far as turning on the light as we were about to sleep in the cold night, we may have tucked our heads under our pillows or under our blankets, we may have checked inside our cabinets and wardrobes should an entity lie inside and we may have looked under our beds under our blinding lights so as to bravely face what was lurking beneath it. \\nto hell with these stories! \"we stopped looking for monsters under our bed when we realized they were inside us\" — charles darwin. \\nand what was a frightening revelation and what may be for others in time was that the real monstrosity in this earth talked like us…breathed like us, laughed like us, worked hard like us, showed compassion like us…and showed gestures of love like us. \\nevil will use even the very actions of what constitutes goodness to hide…and to carry out at all costs their own diabolical acts.\\n\\nyou really know what hurts you and you really know what hurts you, and when you are on the brink of breaking, to turn for and be with the tide of the forces of evil…vengeance is at hand, and so you can imagine the worst things you can do to a person at this point, because it is easy to say you wont do evil when you are not as of the moment vengeful, when you are grateful, and so called \"good\" at the moment, you wont ever feel that you have the capacity to do evil, and when you do decide to look at it…you are  capacity for evil and what you can be capable of doing it scares the hell out of you.\\n\\nrepressed knowledge can mean doing the things you have been horrified of thinking but still doing it. \\nthis is the closest definition i can think of, it is rather unbelievably difficult to articulate.\\n\\nit is something you said you would never do and you might have very well buried it, yet when the moment comes and you are all vengeful like the devil you do it. \\nthe keywords are you repressing it and never having the imagination to do it, and then doing it when the moment comes, versus if a good man really did have the imagination for unspeakable malevolence\\n\\nthis is mans hell and to be touched by malevolence, man can either overcome this evil, fight against it, run away from it, or be a harbinger of death and destruction.\\n\\nmaybe this is why burying and repressing your ideas of what evil you can do to others is a bad idea because you do not open yourself to the possibility of this choice. \\nmaybe inviting the choice of you doing the most evil acts to others to your other alternative choices is what makes this darkness conscious, because i think if this dark choice were to be repressed then one day when evil does touch us and drives us to the edge of vengeance and resentment then this dark choice can be birthed through this vicious emotion thus making your life seem like it is controlled by fate. (idea of jordan peterson/carl jung)\\n\\nunconsciousness is an impulse that we have to do something, and when the times comes when all that we repressed comes back like demons charging through the gates, they will comeback a thousand fold.\\n\\nan unconscious action is something out of the realm of our conscious actions, and so should the evil contained within you be caged, given the right circumstances when all our life we have suppressed these demons. \\nsuddenly they will break out of their cage; they will ravage and destroy the gates of the conscious mind. \\nthus the evil within you has become awakened and conscious. \\nin the representation above the unconscious mind can now seep into the conscious mind for it has destroyed the gates of the conscious mind.\\n\\ni do not know what to do with naivety, for it frightens the living hell out of my soul, knowing if i was touched not only by suffering but also by malevolence and sinister motives, i may become one of the things that i truly wish and pray to god i was not — an agent…a harbinger of death and destruction. \\ni have no solution other than for man to do everything in his power to cast his own wind against the monster…the devil, to be an agent of benevolence, and…to embody the tide of good — fighting against evil.\\n\\nknowing evil firsthand to combat against it vs. naivety first and knowing how to overcome the seduction of evil and knowing evil to combat against it\\n\\nthough my heart; still reserved up to now, as i have been carefully studying and observing my own psyche i have observed that it is rather okay to have influences, for it is influences that do provide the genesis of an idea.\\n\\nthis idea that i have birthed may have originated from a simple idea from an influence, an influence may be a host for a descendant idea, or a host for an ancestor idea. \\nif the ideas you have did in fact grow/originate from a specific idea and this specific idea does originate from specifically a host for a descendant idea then this host may either have been influenced by another host which may be a host for another ancestor idea or a host for a descendant idea. \\na host for a descendant idea may influence one either by a pure idea from another host, or by an idea that originated from a pure idea. \\nit goes on forever up until the host for the ancestor idea is found by finding the true genesis of one who has had an idea originate from another idea which may come from a host for a descendant idea.\\n\\ntherefore ideas of yours do have its origins from the most simple idea, the idea of \\'being defenseless against evil should one choose not to adopt a deep knowledge of evil\\' as such, which did in fact have its genesis out of an influence, jordan peterson. \\nthe cycle may again continue as this idea of \\'being defenseless against evil should one choose not to adopt a deep knowledge of evil\\' may have sprouted from another idea which could either be a conceived idea entirely which therefore makes the individual a host for an ancestor idea, which i also doubt is rather highly unlikely, or an idea in which inception has been performed again with an external agent or an influencer which lets say could be carl jung. \\nand this for example jordan peterson which made the arising of his idea of \\'being defenseless against evil should one choose not to adopt a deep knowledge of evil\\' was made possible because maybe of the influence of carl jung, since the idea which jordan peterson grew and cultivated, could have originated from an idea of carl jung.\\n\\ni seek rather the difference between defending your beliefs by disagreeing ferociously and being ideologically possessed \\n\\nin defending your beliefs i do think that if someone says otherwise about a part of your beliefs and you have this feeling that you disagree, and sometimes you go as far as to impose your beliefs on others and to say that their beliefs are wrong, and yours is superior. this i am afraid is what bedevils me. \\n\\nor maybe ideological possession is ignorance…\\n\\nif i tell you this then you tell me that…\\n\\nit means that they have internalized a pre-programmed script of statements and responses to promote a specific narrative about how things are that, due to logical fallacy (usually tautology, but there are many others), is applicable to any situation. once one accesses that \"script\" and begins to execute it, a series of automatic behaviors emerges that involve no deliberation, judgment, inquiry or, god forbid, personal perspective or creativity. \\n\\nin such a state, people become unable to perform any form of higher-order thinking regarding the subject in question. \\nthis makes them impervious to any logic and evidence, to which they react simply following the particular script they internalized, even when doing so is contradictory, tangential, off topic, non sequitur, observably wrong, etc., for such shortcomings will simply be ignored, dismissed or altogether unperceived. \\nits the perfect recipe for total stupidity, at least while the script is being run, and, in some cases, it never stops running. \\nit is quite hard to win an argument against people who are ideologically possessed, for, as the saying goes:\\n\\nthe difference between genius and stupidity is that genius has its limits. — alexandre dumas, fils.\\n— bruno campello de souza, professor at federal university of pernambuco (2004-present)\\n\\nthe reason why an ideological script gets internalized in the first place has to do with its ability to reduce anxiety by simplifying one  understanding of the world and their associated decision-making, as well as the emotional gratification coming from the collective approval of those who share the ideology. \\nwhen said ideology spreads to the point of providing some level of social influence and power to the leaders of the movement, there can even be economic incentives to following the script. \\nall in all, ideological possession is a dangerous and viral process that must be nipped in the bud when possible, for it is very hard to cure and often intellectually fatal.\\n\\n\"when you tear out a man  tongue, you are not proving him a liar; you are  only telling the world that you fear what he might say.\" — tyrion lannister. \\nand you really are weak if you or one should do this. \\ni liken this idea to handicapping a man so you can fight him easily. \\nand this we know proves not of strength but of weakness. \\nbecause you are avoiding what is difficult which is facing someone on their full strength mirroring this to a critic of your beliefs you are not only proving yourself unable to handle the difficulty of criticism and its shear blows but it truly shows how you embrace weakness so much.\\n\\nweakness…weakness is the most arousing of aromas to our enemies. \\nbut i say unto you it is alright. \\nit is alright that at times we will feel weakness, we will feel fear, and we will feel the need to escape and cower beneath our enemies — our demons.\\n\\ni have observed that there are motivations which do help propel us into facing that which we fear. \\nfor happiness, for satisfaction, to avoid an event from happening, or for survival; these are examples that motivate us from doing an action; and in the absence of motivation, the action that must take place — it will cease to be. \\nhowever reason is different from motivation, for motivation can exist with or without reason, but reason cannot exist without motivation, for motivation itself can be the reason for doing. \\nbut what is reason you may ask? reason is simply the why in doing an action. \\nmotivation??? motivation is what drives man to undertake an action whether it is out of want or out of fear, and these two are what by definition highlights the example of motivations for man to undertake an action or in this case face fear. \\nbe it for survival, to protect, or for happiness, for satisfaction as such, and even the simplest of all i believe — to face fear, to undertake the action of facing fear just for the sake of doing action of facing fear can be motivation enough.\\n\\nas existence precedes essence and man is but a canvas of his true self, in which it is he who decides what he chooses to do or be. \\na man without knowledge placed in the presence of that which he fears the most; to have reason is difficult enough to have but to have motivation…the simplest of all motivation, is possible i believe. \\nthis motivation that is left is to undertake the action itself — to try, to take a leap of faith…to do the action itself it willingly.\\n\\ni must know the bridge between the suffering of life and that of overcoming, the psychological phenomena that occurs within this space is what i must know. \\nnow more than ever i must find this bridge, and now maybe theory is not enough for the satiation of my knowledge. \\nmaybe the answer i seek why weakness must be valued lies in this very space. for i seek to find how man finally decides to emerge from the deepest and most darkest places of weakness, and forge his own strength — to will himself to endure.\\nfor i understand that man will not always face his battles head on, his fears…he will quit, he will give up, he will run away, he will do everything to escape from the cross he must bear like christ once did.\\n\\npart of my fear that of which pointed out that even with reason or motivation it does not mean that man will face that which he needs to face, or the possibility that as a man without that of knowledge i believe cannot have reason or motivation i do have now at this point in history. \\nwhat then is left? what can be reason or motivation? i am  afraid it is only the want to do…to undertake the action itself.\\n\\nyet nevertheless inaction is in it of itself a viable option for man as a watcher, even with reason or motivation, without action…the action of facing fear, such reasons or motivations are nothing.\\n\\nhowever these responses are very…what would i call it? \\ni would say much too simple, as if something must be working in the background, i do not mean to be skeptical but i sense rather doubt in these responses, and i do tend to criticize my own works when the stench of doubt sets in. \\nah yes i now remember…now what is to overcome? \\na close observation of my psyche has led me to see carefully the little habits of what is done to overcome a difficult situation.\\n\\ni must know the bridge between the suffering of life and that of overcoming, the psychological phenomena that occurs within this space is what i must know. \\nnow more than ever i must find this bridge, and now maybe theory is not enough for the satiation of my knowledge. \\nmaybe the answer i seek why weakness must be valued lies in this very space. \\nfor i seek to find how man finally decides to emerge from the deepest and most darkest places of weakness, and forge his own strength — to will himself to endure.\\nfor i understand that man will not always face his battles head on, his fears…he will quit, he will give up, he will run away, he will do everything to escape from the cross he must bear like christ once did.\\n\\ni have been too optimistic or should i say too naïve in watching man…in seeing man triumph over his demons. \\nand slowly i have seen both firstly on the idealistic nature of facing ones fear and the other its rather dark and pessimistic nature. \\nidealistically i am  afraid i have always thought that man when faced with fear who has undertaken the very action of facing fear birthed the idea of courage in that very moment…how pathetic of myself to think of this situation naively. \\nmaybe man won\\'t know the idea of courage itself and by what actions it is defined by, maybe the idea of courage itself was not born in a moment but rather built through a continual observation of embodying to what constitutes the action of courageousness.\\nif reality is or rather has a deterministic element to it, it would be i am  afraid the situation where man remains a coward until death. \\nmaybe some individuals really do lack some kind of will to face that which they are afraid of, and i write a \\'kind\\' of will because of my i believe this is an abstract but at the same time tangible like an object, a concept, an immaterial material that resides in man. \\nthis i believe is its dark nature…the inability of man to take action until his death. \\nyet as long as man lives…he may run, he may cower, he may live in fear forever — the very action of doing, always exists as a chance.\\n\\na psychological response to keep us sane, feel good…safe, arises from a rather terrifying thought for example if one is to undertake arduous training together with recruits let us say, you look around and see inferior individuals who i might say you think you cannot complete the arduous training. \\nand this is what i have witnessed and experienced as a response in undertaking these kinds of training, a rather arrogant response i must say, since it reinforces the thought that if another is inferior then you must be by definition superior. \\nand this is what terrifies me about what arrogance from a façade of a strong mental attitude might bring. \\nthat being said, there is rather a difference between the so called sense of strength one might perceive within oneself through identifying what may seem as an inferior individual and that of the pure strength found only once in the fires of adversity.\\n\\nin ideological possession it is like you doubt their ideology or their so called \"truth\" and then that means you think they are wrong, but i believe there are responses, you doubt, because you think they are wrong, hmm maybe because you think they are wrong is the final response. \\nbut why do you think they are wrong? \\ni think it has something to do with not being ignorant and seeking the true truth, and not being all too confident with what you see at face value.\\n\\nas i have  said once before it is trying/doing that will bring man to overcome hell but the only difference now is i know that he may run away he may cower from it, and he can always have that reason why he should face fear.\\nbut it only comes by doing the action.\\n\\nanother point is because i doubt the action of man to try, to have hope in the face suffering as responses of man is that as the one writing this i am merely a watcher of what and formulate my own ideas in this end of what he can do, but that does not mean that if i were that man i would have these ideas/responses. \\ni am a watcher, a guide not direct but indirect as i do not interact with man i only have opinions and ideas of what he can do. \\nan archangel like michael as i like to think, is thinking also ideas for me, i too must strive to become like him and think of ideas for man. \\nfor i know not how man will respond given the difficult situations, i only have ideas on how he will undertake and overcome these situations. \\ni am afraid this is only a substitute, i know not yet of the real response, but i will strive to find its genesis.\\n\\nnow that i realize it i do have some flaws and this is why debate is important, since you can point out each other  mistakes learn from it and improve the ideology you are advocating to. \\nit is not just about winning not losing, but learning from both sides.\\nand maybe i have been biased in both sides, but i do believe the answer lies in the middle and there are nuances to each side, each side has ideas, like a space, and ones job is not to stay on one side but to examine and discern each idea and create ones own.\\n\\nhow does one live up to a perfect ideal? \\nfor failure to live up to this ideal can be self-destructive. \\nhow does one overcome this? for every ideal i believe is a judge. \\nthe virtues even that i have written about, they are ideals. \\ncourage, endurance, honesty, fortitude, discipline are all virtues that are difficult enough to be acted out. \\ni ask how does one live to up this standard? how can one live with oneself for failure in doing so? what can be solutions to this problem? \\nand if such solutions exist where can its genesis lie.\\n\\nand so i have truly witnessed the true horrors of life and of humanity. \\nit is truly unspeakable, devilish and diabolical with what individuals can do to one another. \\nthe mind of psychopaths or individuals with anti-social personality disorders is what absolutely without question led me to be truly on constant lookout for abhorrently horrifying acts living in the minds of these devils of individuals. \\ni continue and i search for the reason why i kept going forward despite the sheer horror i witnessed. \\ni must confess that in this point in time i had violent thoughts and so one can say i have been enveloped in darkness for a brief period, because in this time i had begun to discover the sheer diabolical manipulative intentions of such individuals with the proclivity to do so, and so i was deeply mortified and i began to find answers as to how one can combat this cancer and wickedness. \\nfor even i was deeply mortified also by the fact that i could be victimized by such a monster, and i in turn would come out exactly like him…a resentment fueled, vengeance seeking devil. \\ni began to employ different tactics as to one should combat this, and so i have done so. \\nwriting this was a succeeding event in the previous events of employing and writing about how to combat this evil — the event of writing this and learning about the true horrors of humanity were not events far from each other.\\n\\nfor the worst sin of all is betrayal and treachery. \\nfor if one has brought upon this unspeakable evil unto you, how then can you put your trust into him again? \\nfor if he can do it, then he can do it again should you put your trust in him again. \\nand now i have an idea for why i have put i would say effort into reading and writing about psychopathic behavior. \\nit was interesting to see too and maybe that is the reason…for now i am  afraid i cannot remember exactly. \\nbut reading why treachery is the worst sin of all just absolutely horrified me, never have i or maybe in some cases, but never have i, i believe have done the gesture of putting ones hand on their mouth in absolute horror. \\nthat is how deeply mortified i was, mixed in with a soundtrack of the biopic of a psychopathic murderer — ted bundy.\\n\\ni was wrong to think the war in life was against tragedy for i thought of tragedy as evil. \\ni have experienced enough and i have witnessed enough evil, if goodness can \\'always\\' be attached to evil then i will fight to the death to make sure i and every single one may live a life where the memory of goodness associated with evil will long cease to remain as a universal but only however as a possibility. \\nfor i will be the first man to embody goodness…genuine goodness, to never use evil for evil but to use it for good and though contrary as it seems i value conflict between good and evil, for without good there can never be evil, and without evil there can never be good — void of duality life would cease to be life. \\nif it means i will be the first man embody goodness without motivations for evil, without any association with evil and only with genuine intentions then so be it. \\nfrom the prologue of this universe up to its epilogue…i will fight.\\n\\nto protect the ones who need protection out of the desire to fight evil can easily be left out as a reason once the desire for vengeance seeps in. \\nto protect the innocent can easily turn from a selfless act into a much darker act — the act of selfishness…the act of selfishly punishing the guilty without the thought of protecting the innocent. \\nthus love for the innocent becomes lust — the lust to wreak havoc against the guilty and all the wrong doers. \\none step further because other than despair, pain and fear, the most difficult situation to overcome i believe other than these three is your insatiable thirst for vengeance — to ravage everything that comes across your path…the destruction of nature coupled with the human race.\\nvengeance against nature and vengeance against humanity who has caused you tremendous suffering — even the innocent.\\n\\nwhen my time comes maybe i will  realize how individualistic society is, for in war a brotherhood is not produced by mutual wants, mutual respect, not even mutual liking. \\na brotherhood is forged in the fires of adversity, to have an unbreakable love for one another through the action selflessness regardless of the personality, attitude, race, thoughts, wants, religion, or ethnicity, to step into the darkness together, to face one  fears together, to endure pain together, and to rise and overcome adversity together.\\nand i only claim to say this, but no one, no one in society will ever give us or fill the void that we have that has always been and always will be filled by the brotherhood that we had.\\neating with each other…telling stories with each other…sitting on a tree with each other…sleeping on a rock with each other…talking around a fire with each other…praying for and with each other; a feeling like it, there is no other.\\n\\ni myself know resentment somewhat too well i believe…but what of other people? \\neven i must imagine deeply that if i were to put myself in others i would feel the lack of courage to even admit to myself that i feel such violent thoughts, that i will feel afraid of confronting such monstrous acts lurking within my soul, for i see myself as much as i possibly can, a good person.\\n\\ngod, fate whatever one may wish to call it, it truly is justifiable to question the structure of reality, maybe even going as far as spiting fate or god, to have vengeance brew in your heart for the unneeded suffering brought upon by tragedy, a tragedy that may very well be interpreted to be something coming from fate…from god. \\ntragedy, it is a condition in which human beings are subjected to the randomness of existence, in which suffering may brought upon humans with the presence of stimuli — tragedy. such as natural calamities, predatory animals, events that lead to suffering that may not be in man  control, and of course a terrible sickness or death for us and most especially our loved ones. \\nit seems justifiable enough to be resentful about fate or god, to curse such, for the pre-conditions of life.\\n\\nevil on the other hand, how does one distinguish it from tragedy? \\nthe answer is perhaps quite clear; evil is infliction of pain of man upon his brother…sister, purely consciously, especially with the hell bent intent and fury of doing so (though others may inflict pain without the intention of hurting someone). \\nyet, is it not a fact that fate or god does the same (or maybe at least does the same with the right intentions, or reasons…who knows?)? \\ntragedy!? tragedy is just malevolence…evil on a metaphysical scale.\\n\\ni too have now taken upon this heavy question…this burden, that i believe has plagued individuals who have practiced, particularly the religion of christianity, since its inception or moreover a question that has burdened man since his dawn. \\nwhy should anyone believe in a god or a deity that has made a world filled with hardships…a world filled with tragedy and evil? \\nhow can man or an individual who has practiced his faith, who has recently discovered such horror, for that matter, worship such a god? \\noh how easy it is to lose not faith, not even belief for god…but the willingness to revere, to trust, and to love a divine being in times of crises that one may able let go of his worries.\\n\\nto this day i know not still, of the reason for why one must even be courageous to face life or why one need still to put faith in or revere god. \\nfor the former i have no answer. \\nand maybe it is justified for man to turn away from god — to have every right to be angry. \\nas a result we become i am  afraid an arrogant individual that is at least in the eyes of the ones who still worship god, an individual who sees the fruits of his own labor not as a blessing from the heavens but by his own doing. \\nyet such an individual i cannot blame for thinking so. \\ni admit that this was supposed to be for man whom i was to only watch, yet i also find myself feeling the same feelings that this hypothetical man i watch may feel towards god. \\ni am reluctant now to worship such a god, but at the same time i beg for the reason why he undertakes such actions.\\ni still want to trust, yet by trusting god who allows such metaphysical evil i also give way towards trusting individuals that wreak evil and what kind of an individual would i be to think or do such a foolish act.\\n\\nfor the latter i have but only one interpretation, and not an answer. \\novercoming transforms us into a much more hardened and courageous individual and maybe it is in god  good intentions that he does such, or maybe he does it for his pleasures sake, which in it of itself is evil. \\nnevertheless, i know not of the true answer.\\n\\ncorruption…corruption is the process by which something is changed from its original use or value to one where it is now to be regarded as something debased — degenerate. \\nwhat corrupts man? \\nthe answer is quite clear — tragedy and evil…the horror of existence. \\nwhen can one say man has been corrupted? \\nthe answer is yet again quite simple — when man has capitulated to his instinct of vengeance — vengeance against god. \\nthus, his character, whatever was present, and whatever will be, all thrown away for the sole action of bringing not of good, but instead, of wreaking evil upon the world. \\nit is undeniable to have vengeful fantasies for the conditions of existence yet it is only once the heinous action is fulfilled, has man then undergone corruption. \\nfrom a being containing the potential for the spark of divinity in order to do good, to a monstrous beast that has, not only brought upon horror, but is steadfast to never turn away from it, that his thirst for vengeance against god might be slaked.\\n\\nit is only in this steadfastness to remain turned away from god, to shackle oneself on one  own volition to an addiction so despicable that the being of man remain solely corrupt. \\nvengeance is an addiction and once one  thirst for it is slaked it becomes difficult to resist from stopping oneself from seeking it out again.\\n\\nlike an ember, in the dark, faintly glowing, while there is still time, while time is present, it is still within mans realm of possibility to set foot on and tread the difficult but righteous path…to turn the tide in his favor. \\nwhile the ember burns, even merely with the faintest of glow of light, redemption will still be always within the grasp of man. \\nbut, so long until man set foot on and tread the righteous path, he remains corrupt.\\n\\nthroughout this journey i have ignorantly i am  afraid, always thought that the ultimate test of man was to live up to and uphold the ideals of courage, the ideals of endurance, to face his fear, and to endure and carry his cross as best he can. \\nmoreover, to attribute a meaning to the conditions of existence that in turn he can withstand it. \\nit is now perspicuous to me that suffering not only has been the condition to live in this universe, but to suffer…to suffer proudly, was the price to be paid forward for being.\\n\\nyet, aside from such tests i have never considered even that such suffering sown into the fabric of existence could also lead man not only to the path of suicide as a consequence of the tremendous pain he faces or will face, but also lead himself to the much darker path of vengeance — vengeance against god.\\n\\nwhile man  strength, tested that is through his courage of heart, and tested through his endurance of spirit, i now see that maybe such virtues were not only virtues to live up to and be upheld. \\nthe last of which, i believe — man  discipline of mind; the discipline to turn away from corruption or moreover to turn away from a corrupt way of life. \\nhaving the courage to face suffering is one thing, and having the endurance to endure suffering is another, but to have the discipline to not capitulate to corruption because of the horrors of existence is yet another test i find to be equally as difficult as the two other trials man is to face. \\nthis i believe to be the final piece of the triad of tests that man is to come through — his final crucible.\\n\\nsacrifice - give up something of value for the future; \"you get to pick your damn sacrifice\" as jordan peterson put. \\nlife is suffering and what may represent a human in this predicament can be cain who is upset about it — about existence itself, about fate…about god. \\nwhen tragedy hits it is easy to blame fate or god. \\nthus the first ingredient for the recipe of mayhem and destruction against fate or god itself is at hand. \\nit is to spite this entity that self-righteously implies, that \"you are wrong to create such a reality full of suffering.\". \\nand now the second step is to create a detailed plan to cause as much mayhem and destruction against fate or god, what i may brutally and quite frankly attribute to murderous minds such as adolf hitler, elliot rodgers, ted bundy, carl panzram, dylan klebold or eric harris.\\n\\nwhen one day you will be faced with an adversary, it is in this moment where ones will to live will be tested, a test to see who will want it more. \\nand you will do everything to survive and sometimes those actions will require the outmost brutality. \\nand so the things you thought you could not do, will be finally be awakened.\\n\\ni have yet to explore this idea of the unconscious more, for in my understanding one thing i have learned is that thoughts in general, that pop out of nowhere has been a mystery to me, and in psychology it is one of actions that are unconsciously done, thus if this is the case talking with these thoughts and having a conversation might then bridge the conscious part of my mind to the unconscious. \\nand another is the idea of the path to hell which i thought to be a terrifying concept, a concept i have derived from one of the great psychologists, dr. jordan b. peterson.\\n\\nthis journey, this hard fought endeavor of destroying and reconstructing beliefs and creating new beliefs respectively has been because of one thing — chaos.\\n\\nthe chaos is the collapse of one  belief systems and left to fend for himself in this sea of chaos or the unknown. \\nthis is what i now understand kierkegaard was speaking about; his notion of angst, or rather his own concept of angst. \\nbut generally his notion of angst and the angst described by existentialist thinkers are of similar if not the same concept. \\nthis angst as i now understood is the dread one feels in the midst of infinite possibility. \\nand now combining it to the collapse of belief systems, broken by an idea that may sow the seed of doubt in one  own belief systems, belief systems that do collapse immediately throw the individual in this sea of chaos, this unknown realm, in the midst of infinite possibility; knowing one is free and able to do anything, but never being able to do anything for one does not know what to choose — this is the vastness of the unknown.\\n\\nchaos, the unknown, the infinite is what is faced after the collapse of beliefs. \\nchaos, the unknown, the infinite is discovering something particularly an idea which may rearrange one  beliefs. \\nchaos, the unknown, the infinite may also be discovering something that may add structure and sturdiness to one  belief system. \\neverything that is waiting to be known or discovered is chaos and what is formed and organized from this chaos upon discovery is called order. \\nchaos and order as reality therefore involves the processes of destruction, reconstruction, and creation.\\n\\nand so with this journey filled with destruction and of reconstruction of beliefs i was briefly thrown in this realm of chaos — it was dreadful. \\nfrom what i learned and understood from nietzsche i am thankful that i was able to reconstruct my belief systems from the ground up using the concept of suffering as the precondition of life and ruling out the other choices one could choose from because of the event of the collapse of his belief systems, however as nietzsche predicted the other alternatives one could cling to was another belief system rooted in rigidity and therein lead to totalitarianism and the other, nihilism, the state wherein angst is present amidst the sea of chaos. \\nand one could conclude or i…a belief system is, better than nothing at all.\\n\\njust my two cents on freud  idea of the tyrannical super ego crushing the id; sometimes in child development the judgment of parents can be so harsh that a child can develop a tyrannical super ego that tells them that even if the action they are about to do is good it will always have an equivalent response of \"blaming\" you for doing this action because it was not in alignment maybe of what your parents said in the past. \\nanother is memories which may be too painful to recall in our memories can be distorted or we can just lie to ourselves to save ourselves the reliving of such a painful memory.\\n\\nif man is to be sent…born rather in this earth as a blank slate, there may be two interpretations one proposed by john locke, and the other by carl jung; one talks about creation and the other discovery respectively of such morals, virtues, ideas, and beliefs. \\nand i think jung was right to reject such an idea that man  morals, virtues, ideas and beliefs were not merely created but discovered, through which i believe or speculate (although i have not read much jung) is birthed through the unconscious.\\n\\nwith the test of the devil, jesus had the chance to wipe out the human race, every opportunity was given to him. \\nto take revenge against those who had made him suffer. \\nand yet in the end he chose not to. \\nthis is the ideal, can man live up to such? \\ncan man choose to put down the gun and walk away, to be truly a righteous individual…to forgive his enemies?\\n\\nthere are two ways to think. \\nto think as a watcher without directly intervening with the subject but indirectly thinking of solutions for the stimuli he may be in the midst of. \\nthe second is to put yourself psychologically in the predicament subject, and what psychological response may arise from said stimuli, for sometimes thinking as a watcher is not enough and the solution you may have conjured as a watcher may not match the psychological response of the subject\\n\\na little quote given by the 4th century theologian, \"right is right even if no one is doing it; wrong is wrong even if everyone is doing it\" — saint augustine. \\ni know now that we will be swayed by others should our courage not be sufficient, the solution is to follow your own path, to not tread the path you do not want, to make a choice, not out of fear, not out of approval, and not out of convenience.\\n\\ntoo much it is for man to bear that others declare and say vicious and nasty things about such man. \"you are  scared\", \"you will lose\", \"you are  not man enough\", \"you cannot  last two minutes in my world\", \"you will never suffer enough\", \"you cannot  do it!, \"i have  had more training than you\", \"i will  always be better than you just accept it\", \"just accept, it you are  going to lose, i have  practiced much longer, i am  much stronger\".\\nthe instinct of man is to believe such negativity. \\n\\nhow can one overcome such condition? \\nmost especially if there is truth involved…if there is strong proof involved. \\nyou are a david against many goliath . \\nand usually the things that makes us better we usually use as a weapon to make others inferior, and therefore the ideal we may have reached which make others inferior judges others instantly. \\nthus the ideal becomes a judge. \\nthese are one of the many preconditions of life that man must overcome aside from the fear that comes in the face of evil, the pain that comes from tragedy, the vengeance that comes from experiencing evil, and the self-doubt that comes from the words of verbally and psychologically ruthless people.\\n\\n\"if i can change, and you can change, everybody can change!\" change always starts with oneself, and if you can overcome your own evil and do good then so can others. \\nall it takes is an idea and then the action, the first born action taken to uphold the ideal of good…to turn away from becoming like evil.\\n\\ni reflect yet again at the idea of my past self, the voice of discipline was always there, the voice of courage was always there, the voice of endurance was always there, telling me to do and what needed to be done, to face what needed to be faced, and to endure what needed to be endured. \\nand in the moment where i have been plagued by the idea of what if such voices were not present? \\nhow could have i acted? \\ni thought of myself as the weakest man on earth, a man with no voices to tell him to face his fear, to do what needed to be done, and to endure most of all suffering.\\n\\nthen it evolved as a story i was writing and how man can overcome such conditions, pain and fear as such, how man can devise a way to overcome such conditions. \\nfor if there was no choice to be made then man had to devise such choices — the choice being, to face his fear, to endure in pain. \\n\\nand now in the present the idea has evolved into the idea of the genesis of virtue…the idea of when man  courage of heart, discipline of mind and endurance of spirit can begin.\\n\\nit is indeed a valid question to which i know not yet the answer to. \\nif there is a god why is there so much suffering? \\nshould man be sent to this world yes he is right to criticize the structure of reality. \\nblame it….lay it even at the feet of god, but what can be such a solution for man to justify his existence, to renounce his hate for god/fate?\\n\\nnow i believe the only problem i have is hurting people unintentionally when i do something for myself. \\ni do not believe in hurting others through my own actions that i do for myself, i was a fool to think before that the actions i did for myself which hurt others was something i did not care to notice.\\nand now being an authentic person i have to reconcile my morality of not hurting others intentionally and having to hurt someone else unintentionally due to my authenticity.\\n\\nlike the king of kings, all virtues may represent a figure in your or in one  life. \\ncombine all these virtues into a single being, and the ultimate transcendent ideal/being is formed.\\n\\nlike one of the greats, jordan peterson, i believe he was right in thinking that to believe in god, it was to be earned through the doing of righteous actions, and the striving to be like christ as best we can. \\nhowever to do otherwise, to say one believes in god yet his actions explicitly portray otherwise, is not by definition true belief in god. \\nfor if one were to merely have the right to believe in god then his actions must be aligned with the epitome or christ like righteousness if not, striving to be the most righteous one can be.\\n\\nand so i ask myself have i done anything that portrays arrogant self-perception, to think that all people are beneath me when i have done the opposite?\\n\\nit is just a sad reality that good men on the side of the enemy have to die by my hand to stop the one who sent them in the first place into war and no matter what i do to, i cannot get around the truth that i aim to always make sure i would join the side of the good to alleviate and justify killing a man on the other side. \\n\\nand this leads to the guilt we may feel, that results from feeling i believe the false sense of moral superiority above others, which is an inescapable punishment, an inescapable psychological punishment. \\n\\nwhen my brothers die in war and i am the only one left after the fog, no one will ever, ever care for me like they did, and i for them. \\nthe wind is cold, the whistling is lonely, the smell is horrific, and the sight of the field is sad…\"ideals are peaceful…history is violent\". \\n\\none of the many reasons man does acts of evil is because he believes that what he is doing is for the greater good. \\n\\nbut other than this reason the most prevalent of all is vengeance and hatred for the structure of reality as well as humanity.\\ntime is still in the hands of man to strive for good. \\nand what is impossible, shall one day be possible. \\npessimistic as it is man is a beast that is selfish, greedy, and murderous. \\nyet i still have faith, such mad faith; even if takes a hundred years, a thousand or even millennia for man to overcome such evil contained within him…to strive for good…then so be it.\\n\\nno matter what it is, doubt can sometimes be the truth we do not want to hear. \\nsometimes it may immobilize us completely; it will make us throw in the towel. \\nbut like fear we must move forward in spite of it. \\nit is a feeling that cannot be shaken. \\nand one may think that there is a way to think out of this feeling. \\none may think to maybe yes we can accept it to save us the misery and say to ourselves that even in the face of this truth we can have faith in the impossible.\\n\\nothers saying \"we are scared\", \"we will lose\", \"we are not  man enough\", \"we cannot  last two minutes in their world\", \"will never suffer enough\", \"cannot  do it\", \"i have  had more training than you\", \"i will  always be better than you just accept it\", \"just accept, it you are  going to lose, i have  practiced much longer, i am  much stronger\".\\n\\nto have faith that even in the face of this \"truth\" we may still change the impossible to possible. \\nfrom having all the odds against us to having the odds in our favor, being the impossible\\n\\nbut to me we are just tricking ourselves…maybe…to rid this feeling of self-doubt…this paralyzing poison. \\ni want to still have this feeling of doubt, to overcome it nevertheless like fear. \\nmaybe like fear the most ideal way to overcome such a predicament is to still keep moving forward — to take action even in the face of all the odds stacked against us.\\n\\nif it is true that nazi germany believed it was jews fault and what they did was a righteous cause this would be a viable idea to believe. \\nthe justification of the action of killing such individuals is powerful. \\nbut is genocide truly the answer for the jews to stop their \"wrong\" doings?\\n\\nwhat is the ideal that one must strive for? \\nthe pain of unrealized ideals or dreams, i yet know not, and quite frankly i yearn for. \\nfor i myself have never made any accomplishments whatsoever in the life that was given to me. \\nit was either myself quitting or leaving the ideal, the dream that was once of importance to me. \\n\\none of the thoughts that haunt me the most…is not, not reaching the peak of the mountain, but to never have at least one mountain be reached at its peak. \\nto never even try and do everything i can to achieve a goal.\\n\\ni see now that i must set myself on at least one great endeavor i may hope to strive for in my life; to find a dream, a goal, an ideal i myself can strive towards. \\nthat one day i may return to the dust or enter the kingdom of god knowing i have reached the top and knowing i have done what i can to do so\\n\\neverything is impossible at first. \\nno one knows what lies after the action. \\nthis is all that it takes…it is  to do the action…it is  to take a leap of faith.\\n\\nhow important it is to speak the truth given the epitome of violence by the 20th century. \\nhistory is so, because of ideology. whether it was having the belief that the hard-working kulaks/farmers where responsible for the poor status of the working class in the soviet union (spec. ukraine) because their wealth was \"stolen\" or that believing that the jews will lead the nazi reich into its demise. \\ntoo often than not evil people do evil acts because they think it is for the greater good of society/the future.\\n\\nand what resulted indeed was the dekulakization of the soviet union, stealing, raping and pillaging from the farmers/kulaks for all what they had because they had \"stolen\" it from the poor leading to the starvation and death of 6m ukrainians or the extermination of 6m jews in concentration camps all because of a belief that they were a threat to the greater nazi reich and the aryan race.\\n\\nhow important is it to speak and seek the truth? because believing in an ideology to be true, which is undoubtedly, a lie, may if not will lead to the eradication of one, maybe two, a hundred, a million if not all of humanity.\\n\\nthis is why seeking the truth is important. \\nbecause what if the truth was that the jews were not in fact responsible for anything wrong they have done? \\nthen all of nazi ideology would have been lies, spewed upon by those sought to carry out their evil.\\n\\na leader may be an outlier who has striven to rise and transcend his human instincts and teach others to strive as well for an ideal, an ideal. \\ni will  have to admit that i do think highly of myself sometimes. \\nnumerous times i was forced or rather i was called upon by life to lead even though i desired not to…i was afraid. \\nbut overtime i became decent at it.\\n\\ni have  always dreamt of a situation where i could finally uphold my morals of standing up for others. \\ni have  once hurt the downtrodden, the different, the innocent…the bullied all because i was intolerant. \\ni failed to see my own insensitivity wrong doings towards others. \\nand once i was bullied i felt what it was like to be helpless; to pray for the bullying to stop every single day. \\ni have  never stood up to the bullied because i was once an individual seeking the approval of others\\n\\ni have  once partook in the conforming action of bullying and hurting someone else. \\nand now it has been a journey of change. \\ni maybe ahead of some people in terms of character i am  afraid and i wish and pray that some or at least most would have the virtues that i always strive to uphold. \\ni may be an outlier. and maybe that is what a good leader is. \\nmaybe it is because a leader has the noble traits of what others ought to also strive for. \\nmaybe i was born or maybe made to lead others towards the ideal of man, the ideal of a noble man/woman.\\n\\ncarrying the cross and facing suffering voluntarily does not create resentment but what evil is done to you that is unwarranted and by no means voluntary, it creates resentment then vengefulness.\\n\\nduring ww1 my grandfather (german) was a very young soldier in verdun too. \\nhe told the following story: one day he and his group got the order to storm the \"enemies\" (french) position. \\nthey jumped out of the ditches and ran towards the other side. \\nmy grandfather soon got shot into both his legs, fell down and lay on the ground. \\nimmediately afterwards a french soldier stood over him with his gun and a bayonet attached on the front of it. \\nmy grandfather expected to get stabbed to death like he had seen so often. \\ninstead the french soldier hanged his gun over one of his shoulders, took my grandfather onto his other shoulder and brought him to a french lazarette…that´s how my grandfather became a pow. \\nhere´s the interesting part: when my grandfather - a farmer´s son from rural north-western germany, who in those days had probably never seen someone from abroad - referred to the french soldier he said (in flat german dialect): \"this guy was t-o-t-a-l-l-y black … as black as coal.\" i recently asked a friend of mine from france what this could mean, and he said that the french army had soldiers from senegal fighting and that they were usually the first ones who had to run against the (german) enemy thus having to bear the highest risk; it´s quite impressive that this guy (from senegal) had nonetheless the courage and humanity to save a live instead of ending it. \\nhumanity is possible — even at war.\\nmy grandfather told this story to his son/my father (a little boy of 13 during ww2) and my father much later told it to me. \\nyou have  already written it how an event unknown to you may give you enjoyment, may make it known to you just how brutal you can be.\\n\\nmy grandfather fought in ww2 as a frontline foot-soldier he remembers how both american and british soldiers would 9/10 shoot surrendering ss soldiers. \\nthere was ones where my grandfather was the one pulling the trigger on a young 16-18 year old ss soldier, my grandfather said to me was \"he had no gear, no ammo, no weapons just the uniform and a picture of his mother in this chest pocket. \\nhe was crying and begging to be taken prisoner. \\nmy officer told me to shoot him because he was an ss or i would of shot for treason. \\ni followed my orders and pulled the trigger. \\nhe was only a boy, only a boy.\\nat this point my grandfather would be crying in to his hands of what he had to do. \\nnot all solders are evil most of them are just following orders, once i became old enough to understand why my grandfather would always cry remembering the war. \\nfast forward 8 years i was able to help my grandfather put his mind to rest, the boy my grandfather shot had a younger sister we and some of the family went to france to meet her she forgave my grandfather…8 months later my grandfather past away happy that he could said sorry.\\n\\ni am a nurse. \\n30 years ago i had a patient who was a survivor of the german death camps of world war ii. \\ni knew this because i recognize the significance of the numbers tattooed on her forearm. \\nthis lovely, poised elderly woman did not point out her tattoo or personal history of suffering. \\nand after we developed a safe relationship as a nurse/patient i asked her one question about her past.\\n\"are you angry with the people who did this to you?\" her answer was this, \"oh darling i am  not angry. \\nthey took 1277 days of my life when i was in that camp. \\nif i am angry i give them one more day of my life. \\nand i refuse to give away anymore of my life to anger & resentment\".\\n\\nsometimes i think that even words and differing beliefs lead to a nasty altercation and possibly, even war between two groups. \\none says another belief and another refutes the other  belief, words are thrown, nasty words, vicious words, until someone snaps, and another retaliates, the other retaliates by inflicting twice the pain, and the other exponentiates the pain that will be inflicted. \\nthis is a vicious cycle.\\n\\nhe who fights monsters should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster. \\nand if thou gaze long enough into an abyss the abyss will gaze back into thou.\\n\\nmy only questions is, if we contemplate too much on evil and our misfortunes with it can man be saved in this predicament or can he be changed. \\ni believe there can be choices here, to take your vengeance, or to face it endure it and be a good person what is wrong with \"committing evil to stop evil\"? \\n\\nis it using also violence to take your revenge on someone, or using violence for good intentions to stop evil, or is it to bring upon evil as well upon the innocent like evil once did. \\nfor if we hold on to this perception of good we so refuse to let go, we would not be able to fight against evil. \\nand once we cannot fight against it, we become vengeful against existence itself. \\nexistence becomes a plague that we must bring down.\\n\\nthe downtrodden may be unconscious opportunities for others. \\nan individual may be oblivious to this event in his or her life. \\nand when finally this event dawns upon this individual  life, he/she may not be able to control the thirst for exploiting such an individual who knows no better than to be selfless.\\n\\nmorally speaking is it still right to ruin someone else  life even when this someone asks you to? \\neven if such downtrodden insists that you take it or exploit whatever they may have to offer out of a misplaced sense of selflessness and lack of self-respect?\\n\\nit can be the case that the downtrodden may lead an individual, unconscious to his own greed to exploiting such a naïve person. \\nit may lead such an individual to the corruption of his soul for power and wealth.\\n\\ncorruption can be anything that transforms an individual into reprehensible beings. \\nevil and tragedy, power and wealth, can transform one into to a vengeful and greedy individual.\\n\\nif the innocent is unconscious of the fact that his life will be ruined if he is to continue this selflessness, then it is in the obligation of the individual addressing this innocent to shed light on the consequences of this so called \"selflessness\". \\nif it is refused this will be a crime, a crime that means exploitation who does not know better.\\n\\nanother scenario is if the innocent is unconscious of the fact that your true state of being is to not be with this person yet this innocent individual still hopes that you will someday. \\na lot of taking advantage can take place in this scenario because should the innocent be unaware of the true feelings of the one being shown such gestures of \"selflessness\" he will give and give until such a time he questions his own hopes of being together with such a person, who reciprocates for something in return only for the material thing or service given to him or her which makes it transactional. \\n\\ngive hoping the favor will be returned until the giver knows your true state he/she will continue to give hoping the favor will be returned, or at least if you do not  return the favor he/she will still continue to give because of the hope\\n\\nthe moral thing to do is will you let this person know what your true state of being or feelings is for this innocent person?\\n\\ni believe it was the first ever war in all the history of mankind - cain killing his brother abel…man declaring war upon his brother. \\nand the first ever weapon for war that cain used to bring wrath upon his brother and to make a statement against fate or god for that matter - a rock.\\n\\nevolved it has, until the spawns of the descendants of cain, tubal cain, forged and made the first of the revolutionary weapons of war.\\n\\nnever have i thought i would dream of constantly going back to such a horrible place. \\noh to imagine how grand it was to be home finally was something, we yearned for, yet as i sit here, now realizing that the world outside has carried on…carried on without me…i was never needed. \\nin hopeless cities, in war torn lands, we were needed. \\npity is not something we are fond of. \\nwe long only for our souls to be fed. \\n\\noutside…long after our consumerist lives…on to the muddy and blood soaked fields we found meaning. \\neven in such suffering, a reminder it was that it was better than the perpetual void of hedonism. \\nreturning to the land of last men, men of excessive consumption, we found ourselves stripped of the very role that made life even in suffering bearable. \\nthey give us pitiful pats on our backs, they give us useless items…things, supposedly to give us the pleasure we \"seek\". \\nhow is there purpose…meaning, to be found in such useless materials? \\nconsuming just to consume with the only struggle being, \"how can i consume more?\" a land of utopian happiness, yet home of individuals with malnourished souls, who claim to always see the grass green yet stand on their dead lawns. \\nthere outside, the fields were red…but the fields were green\\n\\nremoval of a belief system, can be despairing, and thus lead to nihilism, and once a new belief system is introduced that you think is true, but is rigid, it can quite dangerous since it is better than no belief system\\n\\nor when an individual is to afraid or incapable of thinking and constructing his own belief systems when such a rigid solution arises they will take such a solution even if rigid.\\n\\nyet i ask can they, overcome such despair given a pessimistic reality, because the pessimistic reality can be assumed as the constant and what changes is only the person subjected in such conditions especially men. \\nand some men overcome such a reality through self improvement and the only problem i have with this is if i was in there shoes i would have lost myself completely. \\nwho i am now, that of a person with a sense of morals, like honesty, and authenticity will be non existent should i be born in another person  shoes where i get to witness the degeneracy and the wrong of human beings, which would leave me cynical and pessimistic all together. \\nand thus finally losing what is left of myself, through manipulation, and material things just to please such individuals who live such degenerate and unattainable lifestyles.\\n\\nwith a kind faith so sophisticated as yours its hard how do you believe that a cynical and pessimistic reality can be also false and then acting out actions such as finally being authentic to yourself because \\n\\nbecause your response is a sophisticated kind of faith, in the face of such cynicism and pessimism psychologically my response of sophisticated faith will be hidden from a typical individual. \\nsince this kind of faith has been abstracted through a kierkegaardian idea of having faith in the impossible, or at least that is how i understand it, and therefore applied to situations where the impossible is present\\n\\nlike in situations where we feel fear, we may first birth an idea that we can manifest through action, but we are still not aware of the idea of courage or rather the abstraction of multiple events that involve such a feeling and making a conclusion that in each situation that we feel such and we face it that is courage. \\nand thus the idea of courage is born.\\n\\nwe can arrive and be aware of the idea of courage by either merely observing the situation once and say \"okay i feel this fear, and all the times i feel this fear i will be courageous to face it, because sometimes we will not be aware that fear is in a situation ex. sharing your emotions\\n\\nhow does one alleviate a cynical and pessimistic reality, and see it not as an absolute but something that merely occurs for some people but not for all, one that is not universal.\\n\\nlike men killing themselves, because of societies indifference, the psychological state of mind of man is of course think that \"nobody cares about me, i will  just kill myself, i am  not worth in their eyes\"\\n\\nbut man can also turn to loving others and giving love because of the indifference he has felt. \\nand being the first good man/woman in his/her eyes in a world filled yes with evil but also of the goodness he creates.\\n\\nbecause the idea to abstract here is that if someone has hurt you, wronged you, or made you feel powerless and demeaned, you do not bring it upon other people. \\nthe idea is to not do the same actions that your enemies have done to you, you want to be its adversary, to be the good.\\n\\nthis is not a sophisticated morality of showing love and not indifference, but yet it compels me to think about it deeply because what if there are situations where your mind tells you to do something else, and in doing this act you break your morality of showing love, because you have shown indifference\\n\\nwhen we feel that others are indifferent towards us we find a reason to keep going by not becoming such \\n\\na person and showing care towards others. \\nok let  do it this way, you are  statement of others feeling indifferent towards us what do you mean by this? \\nis this applicable in a situation such as where you want to be loved yet the other does not care to make time with us. \\nbecause if you do not know the situations, what i interpret from your statement is that when you give love to maybe let  say everyone, everyone would not take it the way you want it, they may even hate it, and therefore make you bitter.\\n\\nhow does one respond if such a condition is set forth, that being the unavoidable suffering that is born from tragedy and evil? \\nsuppose the condition is already set that god has already put forth the suffering in the world, and abel consciously adds more salt in your wounds apart from the jealousy you feel, by saying nasty and vicious things to you, and maybe this is where all hell breaks loose. \\n\\nof course the common place thoughts in your mind is to hurt this person, and along with it spite god, and again we face the dilemma that maybe in history, it was common place to retaliate against those who have said foolish, hurtful, or vicious things that make a man take revenge\\n\\nall i have are ideals that keep me sane in ideas such as this\\n\\nideals of words are just words \\n\\ni mean i only have rules on how to act when evil is being done but if evil has been already been done, i have no rules for, or at least i am in conflict with different rules/actions i am trying to uphold, do we take vengeance, do we not take vengeance for however many reasons…what??? \\ni am conflicted.\\n\\nvengeance is an addicting vice. \\nonce you stop short of your original dosage or stop all together, it is a pain that is unbearable. \\nlike an immediate and instant withdrawal from an addicting drug or vice.\\n\\nyes you may have found respite for doing such things for the masses who want to do good, but such pain can never go away, you may killed the perpetrator but such helplessness, such trauma and, such loneliness can never go away. \\nyou will  never get to see your family again, and that is a difficult thing to come to terms with.\\n\\nmaybe this is where forgiveness is the answer…the letting go of hate in our hearts…\\n\\na reason for punishment can be for the doer to stop what wrong he will be doing in the future, for it can never be certain when he will stop. \\nit can be done by killing him or immobilizing him. \\nrespectively for the reasons being, because he will never stop or he might be able to redeem himself by leaving such a life forever\\n\\nbecause if the wrong doer knows that you let all his wrong doings pass he will keep doing it.\\n\\nthe first time he does something and you have not gotten the chance to stop the process and the damage has already been done, you can either let it pass, or punish him\\n\\nif you let it pass he will do it again, because he knows there is no consequence for his wrong doing\\n\\nbut if he does it again to you and the damage has been done, and you punish him for it, he knows that the next time he does that wrong doing he will be punished for it, he does not bother you anymore. \\nthis is the idea, an idea that can be applied to people being bullied.\\n\\nyou talk about fighting against evil, but what about the accomplices which indirectly contributed to such a wrong being done to you? \\ni fear one may become truly a monster when coming to such a realization. \\nyes the individual or man for that matter can think it through deeply why he should not hurt accomplices of evil who seem to be doing it probably for their own good intentions or probably bad. \\nbut nevertheless, who does want to go through such an arduous task, why not be done with it and punish those who contributed to such evil being done, or who contributed to such evil getting away.\\n\\nmost especially in a situation where an individual witnesses or experiences a wrong if not evil being done towards his family or himself and such a perpetrator is let go or is dealt poorly by the system which leaves the victim vengeful against those he deems were accomplices with the evil doer\\n\\neveryone is capable of evil should they learn to voluntarily peer into their own unconscious mind. \\nyou know you can be violent, and being violent is in your realm of choices, but you do everything to choose a different path.\\n\\ncapable of physical violence, capable of vicious and demeaning words, but like a martial artist who has practiced his technique for a long time. \\nhe is dangerous. \\n\\nlike you who knows weapons of evil like lying to get what you want, emotionally manipulating someone, is something you know you could do. \\nbut you choose to tell the truth instead of lying non-chalantly. \\nit is within your capability to do so but you choose not to use it.\\n\\nand the capability to use power for subjecting people to tyranny but choosing not to.\\n\\nwhat defines sophisticated thinking? \\nit is when the psychological bridge between stimuli and the ideal response is longer (a train of multiple railway carriages that contain thoughts) than it should be. \\nor such a stimuli or a problem is too hard to answer that another should resort to writing it down, and manifesting the problem physically through a written question/problem, that it may be easier to answer.\\n\\nif man that is arrogant is to be struck down by god then god still by definition is the architect of the suffering of such man. \\nbut why does man hold such arrogance? \\nwell the answer is quite obvious it is an arrogance that stems from the realization that god is morally beneath him because of the tragedies, the metaphysical evils he brings forth upon humanity, and it is a realization that one knows, such actions are not right.\\n\\nwhat was job thinking when he was struck down either some unfortunate events or even by god himself? \\nthese are plausible ideas to think about.\\n\\nmaybe yes i need to be humbled, i have never experienced tragedy, not ever, not yet. \\nthe question is will i still trust and worship god for it\\n\\ni said what i said. \\nit is  not that i do not  believe in god, it is  not that i hate god (but maybe i will one day and i am  sorry), it is  just hard to understand that god is all powerful, all knowing, and most especially all good.\\n\\nand it is hard when people you love, try to keep you away from knowledge that challenges ones beliefs. \\nit is hard when all you are trying to say is you are distanced from god and liken it to the minds of murderers. \\ni am not against god, i merely only want to be distant from him. \\n\\nyou know what yes there will always be evil, but that does not  give us the right to not do everything that we need to do to rid this world of evil. \\nit is our responsibility. \\ni am responsible for you and everyone just as you are responsible for me and everyone.\\n\\nat the back of my mind maybe i do know the answer. \\nas much as there is suffering, to hate someone or god for that matter is a hurt that can be let go should one choose to. \\nseeing someone suffer, you blame god, yet one can still learn to love god in the presence of such suffering of others and of yourself. \\nbut what does this say of our morality when we love god or even our enemies for that matter who seek to wreak suffering upon us? \\nshould they be stopped? \\nif in fact they should be stopped, do we stop as well the natural evil that god himself brings in the world, should we be given the chance?\\n\\ndo not, actions, that others expect of you, but do such actions on your own accord. \\nto choose to do good, to want to do good.\\n\\nthis is why nietzsche regarded most morality as cowardice, because why do you do good? \\nis it because of the law? \\nis it because you are afraid of the law? \\nand this where ones capability of evil plays in. \\nif you know you are capable of such evil and you know it is within your realm of choices, you actually fear doing it so it is  still cowardice. \\nbut what if i told you that you actually choose to do otherwise evil not because of fear no, but of your own accord, because you want to do good. \\nthen the act of choosing good over evil is driven not only by fear but of wanting to do good.\\n\\nit is all a test.\\na test of our love towards not the people we adore but of our enemies.\\na test of our courage towards not what we can easily face but the things we fear the most.\\na test of our endurance towards not what we can endure easily but of tremendous suffering.\\nand a test of our discipline towards not, in the face of life devoid of tragedy and evil, but of a life full of it without leading ourselves to corruption.\\nmaybe i was just terrified of having an answer against a difficult argument. \\nsome part of me just felt that this battle was a losing battle, that there was no simple answer or any answer for that matter against this powerful enemy.\\nbut maybe there is an answer. \\nan answer that i denied time and time again because i felt like i never wanted this powerful enemy \\nto be built up and crush anything only to be destroyed by it is  rivaling answer\\n\\nto turn the other cheek is easy to say, and i think this is what terrifies me\\ni see it in my mind eye…i feel not only a deep compassion for them but of empathy, and love. \\nand somehow though we suffer, and maybe even suffer because of god  doing, it is our love that spills over even towards our most contemptible of enemies, god even whom we have made our enemy, we have learned to love. \\n\\nwith the foundation of christianity, meaning lies beyond, in the heavens, and this is what gives man the capacity to withstand the suffering of life.\\n\\nin the emergence of science, yes scientists will have replaced their own belief systems with the knowledge they have discovered, but what about the masses? \\nthey have no leaning towards becoming scientists or philosophers for that matter, and so what replaces it? \\nthe answer…nihilism\\n\\nonce science is introduced the collapse of christian teachings and beliefs manifests. \\nand so you start to ask yourself \"if heaven does not exist then what could have been my predicament had i, not had such a belief? how would have i moved forward if the meaning of heaven was not present?\"\\nalso if belief in one system is false, psychologically the subject begins then to doubt other belief systems and therefore, result in a radical rejection in all belief systems as a consequence. \\nif one shatters, its destructive waves could bring about the collapse of other structures.\\n\\nit is incredibly insightful and i may go even as far as my ideas being paralleled to it, dostoevsky  justifications for killing and the consequences that come after doing so. \\ni have always thought that no matter how hard i try to justify it, a soldier for example in the front lines of war, when given the opportunity to kill his enemy because he needs to, for the betterment of his side, or maybe because such an enemy deserved to, because of his sins, will still experience the same tormenting questions that i too have contemplated upon.\\n\\nas i interpret it the reason why he described man a piano key, it is because like a piano key a piano key is to touched and pressed, and to press means to inflict suffering upon man that he may overcome it. \\nif suffering is taken away and man is placed in a utopian realm, he will willingly seek to bring about destruction upon the world he has been born into. \\nhe will find a seat in which he finally watches the rotten fruit of his labor. that is, in watching the world burn before his eyes.\\n\\nnotes from underground (1864) is a blistering assault on utopianism, socialism, and marxism based on dostoyevsky  view of human nature. \\neven if a utopian society was attainable, says dostoyevsky, we would not be satisfied by endless food, comfort and pleasure. \\nif you satisfied every human desire, we would throw it all away just for something interesting to happen, just to give ourselves a challenge to overcome and prove that we are human beings and not lap dogs. \\naccording to dostoyevsky, we would rather wallow in misery and self-pity than be handed everything on a silver-platter! \\nit is our unique proclivity for destructive decisions that make us human, and we would not  give that up for anything…even heaven on earth.\\n\\n\"now i ask you: what can be expected of man as a being endowed with such strange qualities? \\nshower him with all earthly blessings, drown him in happiness completely, over his head, so that only bubbles pop up on the surface of happiness, as on water; give him such economic satisfaction that he no longer has anything left to do at all except sleep, eat gingerbread, and worry about the non cessation of world history — and it is here, just here, that he, this man, out of sheer ingratitude, out of sheer lampoonery, will do something nasty.\"\\n\\neither you die a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain\\n\\none could say to the suffering individual that he has an unconscious desire to wreak upon death and destruction upon the world should his wish to remove suffering completely is to be granted\\n\\none could say also that man  desire for suffering even if he desires comfort in the midst of suffering is another notion he is unaware/unconscious of\\n\\ni believe this is why religious people although i may be generalizing, rejected superficiality, materialistic and hedonistic tendencies. \\nfor if he is to be given everything he will be quick to give back everything just so he can have again nothing.\\n\\nsuffering has always been sown on the fabric of existence lest that man create suffering on his own accord…that he become a monster of his own making.\\n\\ni believe in man  will to meaning, i do not  believe in man  will to power, i do not  believe in man being driven by merely sex, and i do not by any stretch of the imagination believe that man is only to be driven for the sole purpose of happiness. \\nhappiness is expendable, but a reason to live…that is forever.\\n\\nif one is to turn the other cheek from god why not do it again but this time for humanity? where does one draw the line of tolerating evil? \\ndo we tolerate this evil? \\nwhere does one draw the line in tolerating evil things being done? \\ni guess the ideal of turning the other cheek even if we were wronged works only for few individuals — an individual with the greatness within him to do so.\\n\\nhowever i would also argue that if good is to be above evil, how does one implement this without being an adjudicator of reality itself, an adjudicator that reaches metaphysical levels?\\n\\nthe context has to be known that maybe at the height of christianity everything considered to be outside the morality of the religion of christianity was to be immoral and therefore worthy of punishment. \\ni believe this to be the interpretation of what dostoevsky mean when he said that \"if there is no god…\" then therefore \"everything is permitted\".\\n\\nin a world full of hurt, be the good in the world. \\nlove your enemies, for you know you are capable of eliminating all of them, but you choose to not cause pain anymore, because you yourself have experienced it. \\nlove them…it fills me with regret that i beat my enemy to a pulp, that i was carried away by my own impulse to punish him for his/her sins for lacking love, loyalty, compassion, empathy and only cared about his/her own selfish desires\\n\\nbut not anymore, my meaning is to be the good in this world that i may redeem myself, to be love instead of the hurt. \\ni have been hurt and the last thing i ever want to do again is to hurt others regardless of what they have done, because i myself know what it feels like to be hurt. \\nbut not anymore…lest that i become another person who is indifferent to the suffering of others\\n\\nif i can feel this love and compassion and empathy for this imaginary, possibly fictional character, the beaten man who was left for dead; to also have the iron will to help because of the love and compassion and empathy i feel…then everyone can \\n\\nto aim for the ultimate good is the ultimate meaning man can derive from a life of cruelty and suffering. \\nas of now the good you feel is synonymous to love, and compassion, no more hurting people.\\n\\nwith all that i have  learned about morality, i want to be someone other than those kinds of people who perpetuate hurt, instead compassion and love and empathy is what i think people need. \\nbut at the same time the dark side must never be repressed but rather be used for the good of the world.\\n\\n\"art is to console those who are broken in life\"; i do not  know what it is about art. \\nmaybe the beauty is what makes me feel love and peace despite knowing, witnessing, and experiencing the troubles of the world.\\n\\ngoing back on the promise that man will never hurt anybody, there is nuance here because he needs to know that if he is pitted against the decision of stopping evil by killing evil which is by definition hurting that individual or sparing him, he must make the difficult decision of killing that individual who does evil. \\nand maybe the rationalization for this is that he will never hurt anyone out of resentment or the need to hurt that individual but out of the protection and well being of others, that they may be saved from the clutches of evil. \\nbut no matter how man tries to rationalize his situation, the promise, of not hurting anyone not even evil, has been broken. \\nthat is the price to pay for taking anothers life.\\n\\nin a society, in a city, in a country, and in a world, where corrupt individuals are prevalent, there exists the sadistic few that derive pleasure from the \"heroes\" that seek to rid the world of their presence, but it comes at a price - to kill. \\nand for a hero to eliminate evil, what that means for those said few is, they have won, they have won by validating their own belief that even heroes who claim to be good, need the will to hurt others, which in turn breaks their own promise to be good.\\n\\ni believe this to be the case that my thinking, from what i can tell that has been a long time, was right all along, that if god were to come down on earth and say that suffering is necessary, that tragedies such as sickness, accidents, death, and nature  fury as such were by his doing, we as humans would i am  afraid question why or even go as far as punish god for admitting it. \\nthis thought has always knocked time and time again in my mind.\\n\\nwith the grand inquisitor indeed questioning christ like most people would, because of his admittance that he was the cause of suffering for the world and thus it makes me empathize with the poor deeply that they are born in such circumstances. \\n\\nand then christ kisses the grand inquisitor showing him that even in such suffering, if one is to blame god, and thus sink in to corruption, nothing will come out of it, but if one should promise to not hurt others like god already has, no more hate, and no more resentment, but love not only for the people who suffer, love that spills over even to god.\\n\\nmeaning is whatever that is that attaches you to the world and whatever prevents you from suicide. \\nfor having this meaning is what makes us want and love to live. \\n\"i will be courageous until existence is at its end.\"\\n\\nthis is why, when man is to pass the test of discipline to turn away from vengeance because he wants to be a good person, being a force for good is not enough, for it only keeps one away from mass murder or slaking his thirst destruction. \\n\\nsuicide is still a problem, and there must be a sustaining meaning that makes the existence of man worth living\\n\\nwith social media nowadays and maybe i am  a hypocrite to say this but, i am  hurt even further that even my family does not  even give the chance to listen to what you have to say or respond to simple questions you have because they are  too busy with their phones\\n\\nwhen others deny us the love that we need that hurts. \\nand so we do it best to not do the sins or shortcomings of neither our peers nor our forefathers. when someone needs love, one ought to do the right thing, and show and express your love for them back.\\n\\nmaybe it is true that we have invented statements like your worth is not defined by your money or how many partners you have been with because we ourselves know we can never live a lifestyle, and to cope with our incapability, inabilities or imperfections we invent these things to rationalize our situation\\n\\nbut what happens when we do get it? \\ndo we have our worth then?\\n\\nmaybe it is the truth that we have no worth in those kinds of people  eyes, but, we can create our own worth not by hating ourselves because we could not  live up to their ideal, but instead replacing that hate with self-love. \\nand building ourselves that we may love ourselves more and have worth not by others eyes but by our own.\\n\\ni speculate that in that the reason why persecution of those who had their own way of following christ would lead to the realization of the leaders in power that their belief in god was not absolute and…\\n\\nbecause as i have learned also that the context has to be known that maybe at the height of christianity everything considered to be outside the morality or the ways of the religion of christianity was to be immoral and therefore worthy of punishment\\n\\nand this ties in with the future of decline of christianity in the 19th century onwards. \\nfor if everything one has come to know as the truth, the absolute, and the only way is fractured, if not destroyed; the only thing left is nihilism and the chaos that pounces and knocks endlessly in ones mind. \\ni think more than anything the leaders of the inquisition knew and feared this impending phenomenon.\\n\\njordan peterson was talking about how ideology can make us defend our beliefs to the very end and even go as far as make us commit genocidal acts. \\nhis book maps of meaning may be able to solve this question and this speculation i have about the inquisition and how the so called dogma of christianity was the prevalent ideology in that specific period in time\\n\\n\"if there is no god everything is permitted\" — fyodor dostoevsky\\n\\nstanding up to evil people is no easy task, and i think most people would agree on that. \\nbut in my deeper perspective, reading crime and punishment written by another great existentialist, dostoevsky, made me realize that even if we were given all the justifications to eliminate evil and morally reprehensible people akin to the sin of raskolnikov against that pawn broker, i believe that we still cannot escape the tormenting guilt and the psychological toll of taking the life of one human or another. \\nand one way i believe guilt stems from; it stems from the action of seeing oneself as morally superior to anyone you deem morally reprehensible — to have the thought that such individuals are the scum of the earth belonging only beneath your established moral high ground.\\n\\nit could be the case i believe that the soldiers returning home from war, (a war fought even with a cause so just that it is an impossibility to not see the spectacle of the battle of good against evil take place, the righteous adjudicating the immoral) who bore the heavy toll of the expectation that was placed upon them by everyone, that being to protect by being violent, to advance towards enemy lines, to dehumanize their enemy, and finally to bring judgment upon the them through the taking of their life, cannot seem to shake the fact still, that as the ones who fought in and witnessed the carnage of war, they themselves have taken another  life\\n\\nand that i believe is the price one has to pay not for just being a soldier and fighting for a good cause, but standing against evil and having to stop if not eliminate this individual or group who seeks to wreak evil, by taking their lives.\\n\\nwhen there is danger you and i must understand that we need not to suppress our emotions but despite it act to protect our tribe, because it is our duty to do so - to stop evil and to protect the innocent. \\nin the end, we will mourn with each other and for each other, tears need not to be a sign of weakness, but a sign that we are in need compassion, and that compassion as well as love will be given.\\n\\nto do evil a human being must first of all believe that what he is  doing is good, or else that it is  a well-considered act in conformity with natural law. \\nfortunately, it is in the nature of the human being to seek a justification for his actions…\\n\\ni ask now, should man be given the power, to conquer the world, will his intentions be lies? \\nwill his intentions be irrational? because he himself knows what he will be doing is irrational, and such a thought will frighten him enough to do everything in seeking a justification for his actions — that his cause may be quote unquote \"righteous\".\\n\\nsomehow i believe it to be the case that, man, needs a meaning in his life, a meaning that can sustain him which terrifyingly can be found in the context of war or even to wage war.\\n\\ni found that if there is no striving, that stagnation begins to brew or even going as far as insanity as a consequence of the boredom that plagues man. \\n\\nand this goes back to maybe the argument of some radicals, that men are to conquer even if such things are irrational and leads to the death of millions in order to have meaning, not to, as they say \"settle down\", and stop ones \"lust\" for life.\\n\\nwell now i believe this opens up a new chapter for man - his irrationality. \\nwill he throw away his connections with his family for meaning? \\nwill he kill people, kill children, commit genocide out of his \"instinct\" of needing to conquer…to dominate, with the intention being exactly only, out of his situation lacking chaos, excitement, suffering?\\n\\nthis to me i think is by far the most cynical idea about human nature and it frightens me. \\nand now another chapter, another front has opened in this journey pertaining to the irrationality of man. \\nthe question that can most probably sum up this idea is: can man ever stay good, or will he squander everything he has that is of value?\\n\\nmorality plays a huge part in helping a suffering individual. \\nfor this individual may be lacking the will to go on because of the lack of human connections. \\nand i myself am still trying to puzzle this piece this idea, to relate it to this journey of man.\\n\\nto listen, to give compassion, and to express love to an individual was indeed the right thing to do. \\nfor sometimes we may think that the world does not care, but there are good samaritans as well that do care, for they themselves

love, and to do right, when we ourselves have been wronged.\\n\\n\"an action, to have moral worth, must be done from duty\" — immanuel kant\\n\\nwhat if all of it, this human experience, this feeling of love, this will to overcome, was…i cannot seem to find the words. \\nbut i cannot help but get cynical and ask what if such experiences were…lies…illusions…evil…i have no exact words.\\n\\nirrationality, this is something i have discovered, that when it comes to morality we break it and voluntarily become monsters of our own making just for the sake of eliminating boredom, stagnation, and to yet redeem ourselves once again — to strive for something. \\n\\nand when in relationships everything stable we throw away because of our irrationality, because of our need for chaos.\\n\\nwhy cannot  we have a peaceful life? \\nwhy cannot  we have a quiet life? \\nwhy cannot  we have a simple life? \\nwhy do we need excitement? \\nwhy do we need mystery? \\nwhy do we need unpredictability? \\nwhy do we need someone to fight? \\nboredom i say firmly is the new enemy to be feared and yet also to be conquered.\\n\\nsuch questions torment me, for i, i admit have dreamt and longed for companionship that would be stable for years to come, until death. \\nbut maybe that only is an ideal — not however grounded in reality. \\nthis is to my perspective a kind of utopian union between partners. \\nunfortunately i am  afraid man can be a stupid creature sometimes.\\n\\nand maybe now i agree with dostoevsky  insights on the irrationality of human beings. \\nin the context of a relationship we individuals, we crave security and yet we want and. \\nand sometimes, when overdone, leads to hurt, intense suffering and sickness, of the heart. \\nwhy i ask did god make such human beings? \\nwhat i want is an answer a reason for mans irrationality.\\n\\ndostoevsky  book notes from underground is an insightful book on the true nature of humans. \\nwe like to think of ourselves as rational beings and capable of conducting ourselves in logical ways, but dostoevsky has a different perspective.\\n\\nhe seems to have a very cynical perspective when it comes to the nature of humans. \\nhe absolutely hates the notion that if we strived to be more rational and understand the potentiality of the human race, we would stop acting in ways that harmed ourselves and society and would be able to usher in the utopia that we all long for.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"but these are all golden dreams. \\noh, tell me, who first announced, who was the first to proclaim that man does dirty only because he does not  know his real interests; and that were he to be enlightened, were his eyes to be opened to his real, normal interests, man would immediately stop doing dirty, would immediately become good and noble, because, being enlightened and understanding his real profit, he would see his real profit precisely in the good, and it is  common knowledge that no man can act knowingly against his own profit.\"\\n\\ndo people only do \"bad\" things because they are ignorant of their profit, or in the economist  perspective, their \"utility\"? \\nis it true that, once we are enlightened of the potential for utopia, we would not  do things that would consciously go against our own well-being?\\n\\ndostoevsky believes this perspective to be naive, and mocks the people who believes this to be true \"the pure, innocent child!\"\\nhe counters this argument by saying that there were millions of instances where people have knowingly went against choices that would bring them the greatest \"utility\" and well-being.\\n\\n\"what is to be done with the millions of facts testifying to how people knowingly, that is, fully understanding their real profit, would put it in second place and throw themselves onto another path, a risk, a perchance, not compelled by anyone or anything, but precisely as if they simply did not want the designated path, and stubbornly, willfully pushed off onto another one, difficult, absurd, searching for it all but in the dark.\"\\n\\nthere is something about being given the freedom to choose for themselves, no matter how self-defeating or self-harming, that entices us and makes us stupid (in a rational perspective.) we will readily give up everything for the sake of this freedom to choose, just to prove that we are capable of this ability.\\nhe then entertains a hypothetical situation where reason and science will have advanced to the point where every action, thought, and desire made by a person will be identifiable as a law of nature, and will be able to have an answer for every single thing that happens in the universe.\\n\\nthe real reason that this utopia is not  implemented yet is because people are \"not yet accustomed to acting as reason and science dictate,\" and after some re-education and alignment with the goal, it will be inevitable and we will all be happy when we get there.\\n\\n\"though man has learned to see more clearly on occasion than in barbarous times, he is still far from having grown accustomed to acting as reason and science dictate.\\n\\nbut even so you are perfectly confident that he will not fail to grow accustomed once one or two old bad habits have passed and once common sense and science have thoroughly re-educated and given a normal direction to human nature.\\n\\nyou are confident that man will then voluntarily cease making mistakes and, willy-nilly, so to speak, refuse to set his will at variance with his normal interests.\\n\\nmoreover: then you say, science itself will teach man that in fact he has neither will nor caprice, and never did have any, and that he himself is nothing but a sort of piano key or a sprig in an organ; and that, furthermore, there also exists in the world the laws of nature; so that whatever he does is not at all according to his own wanting, but of itself, according to the laws of nature.\\n\\nconsequently, these laws of nature need only be discovered, and then man will no longer be answerable for his actions, and his life will become extremely easy.\"\\n\\nnow a lot of people believe that they have free will, because, they feel like they are  choosing to move their hands and feet and have the phenomena that, when they will it to happen, it happens.\\n\\nbut what if science is able to prove that you really never had free will but only had the illusion that you were controlling your thoughts and your hands and feet? what if they could predict every thought and action that you would do?\\n\\nwould any endeavors in your life mean anything if you were already destined to achieve them? would there be any utility in thinking for yourself anymore, if you already have the definitive answers?\\n\\nwould people finally be happy? \\nif there was an answer to everything in life and everything about yourself, would it truly be heaven on earth?\\ncan we finally live in peace, eat cakes and lounge around, and live happily ever after?\\n\\nmany people would accept this utopia and say: \"why the heck not?\" we won\\'t need to needlessly suffer anymore, and everyone will be happy! this is what we were created for!\"\\n\\ndostoevsky allows you to think that this is seemingly a good idea, until he points to another attractive trait that people tend to have: ungratefulness.\\n\\n\"man really is stupid, phenomenally stupid. \\nthat is, he is  by no means stupid, but rather he is  so ungrateful that it would be hard to find the likes of him. \\ni, for example, would not be the least bit surprised if suddenly, out of the blue, amid the universal future reasonableness, some gentleman of ignoble, or, better, of retrograde and jeering physiognomy, should emerge, set his arms akimbo, and say to us all: \"well, gentlemen, why do not  we reduce all this reasonableness to dust with one good kick, for the sole purpose of sending all these logarithms to the devil and living once more according to our own stupid will!\\nthat would still be nothing, but what is offensive is that he would  be sure to find followers: that is  how man is arranged. \\nand all this for the emptiest of reasons, which would seem not even worth mentioning: namely, that man, whoever he might be, has always and everywhere liked to act as he wants, and not at all as reason and profit dictate; and one can want even against one  own profit, and one sometimes even positively must (this is my idea now).\\n…and where did all those sages get the idea that man needs some normal, some virtuous wanting?\\nwhat made them necessarily imagine that what man needs is necessarily a reasonably profitable wanting?\\nman needs only independent wanting, whatever this independence may cost and whatever it may lead.\"\\nhe predicts that even when we are sitting in utopia, we will be eternally ungrateful for the things we have.\\nit will  be so boring and predictable that, against all common sense and rationality, people will start breaking things just to see something else happen.\\n\\n\"shower him with all earthly blessings, drown him in happiness completely, over his head, so that only bubbles pop up on the surface of happiness, as on water; give him such economic satisfaction that he no longer has anything left to do at all except sleep, eat gingerbread, and worry about the non-cessation of world history — and it is here, just here, that he, this man, out of sheer ingratitude, out of sheer lampoonery, will do something nasty.\\nhe will even risk his gingerbread, and wish on purpose for the most pernicious nonsense, the most non-economical meaninglessness, solely in order to mix into all this positive good sense his own pernicious fantastical element.\"\\nwe will sacrifice utopia itself just to prove our point and confirm our beliefs: we are not piano keys but are individuals capable of individual wanting.\\nwhat makes you think you would  be happy if you had everything you ever wanted? \\nmaybe you are  able to be satisfied because you know what it feels like to be dissatisfied. \\nwhat constitutes paradise for us humans?\\nwhat do we really want?\\na rather funny reality this is, where even if we get to the \"perfect ending\" or heaven on earth, we have the inclination and maybe even the innate desire to destroy it.\\n\\n\"what can be expected of man since he is a being endowed with strange qualities?\"\\nnotes from underground is a brilliant book criticizing the limits of rationality and the mistakes of bringing in utopia. \\nwe actually do not  even want to live in a world where we are simply known as piano keys. \\nwe want to be free thinking creatures who are capable of making decisions, good or bad, or at least think that we have the capability.\\nhowever much we suffer, however much pain we face in the world, we are still able to feel free and feel like we are making decisions for ourselves, which makes all the difference.\\neven if it is an illusion and we are still governed by the laws of nature, we still want to live in ignorance and feel that we are the ones in control of our thoughts and desires.\\nmaybe that is  the most important part about being a human.\\ni hope that this does not depress you, but enlightens you of our own nature. \\nthis is not  to say that we should not  continue to strive for a better future for humanity as a whole.\\nmaybe dostoevsky was short sighted, and maybe he was wrong about us. maybe we can grow \"accustomed to reason and science\" and usher in the greatest era of humanity that no one could have imagined.\\nalthough it may take a herculean effort to prove him wrong, it cannot  hurt to try our best.\\n\\ni believe this to be the case that maybe the psychotherapist esther perel may have influenced me on the idea of love and desire being two paradoxical notions part of the nature of man, which by the way can be a part of a bigger picture of mans nature, that is, him desiring a life free of suffering but also wanting it should it be removed. \\nthis problem i believe is already solved, because there needs to be suffering, but there also needs to be the meaning and/or reason to withstand it. \\nthe same i believe is applied with love and desire. \\nwe cannot hope to eliminate our need for novelty, for unpredictability.\\n\\ni do not know what it is with humans; we could care less about what we did to others even if unjust, and yet we become bitter when we ourselves are treated unjustly, when we are wronged. \\nwhy morality is a responsibility is because of the fact that again, sometimes if not most of the time we humans, could care less how we treat others if not, go as far even as to wrong them, yet when we ourselves experience being wronged or expect to be treated justly and not receive it we become bitter. \\nrelationships for instance, we do not  want to be cheated on and yet we find ourselves wanting to cheat on our partners. when it comes to property, we do not  want to have our material possessions stolen and yet we find ourselves having the inclination if not wanting to take other individuals material possessions. \\nwe want to be done right by others and yet we could care less if we do them wrong. \\neven one of the oldest moral concepts, moral codes to exist, that originated from confucius himself was about that of morality being a responsibility even, the responsibility to treat others justly: \"do not do unto others, what you do want others to do unto you.\"\\n\\nthe fact of the matter is we expect to be treated justly, however it does not mean that we will treat others justly as well, this is why morality is a burden — a responsibility. \\nand so the question arises, why should we have or adopt a moral code? \\nwhy should we not hurt others when we ourselves have been hurt? \\nfor you know we have the freedom still to perpetuate even the sins of our forefathers, yet still be treated justly and so why abide by the moral code of acting morally when we ourselves could care less of doing unjust actions towards others still? \\nwhat of people who haven\\'t done anything that could be of use or good to us that results in us being obligated to return the favor; why care about how we treat them at all?\\n\\nthis is the weight, the burden of being moral, and i am  afraid even our willingness to do good, to be moral; that in it of itself is also a form of responsibility, yet i would fret not, for these acts we may have the willingness still to do — to want doing it.\\n\\nmaybe the action of doing good…that in it of itself is the meaning that can sustain us…to prevent ourselves from being corrupted by the horrors of existence. \\nit is the meaning that prevents us from taking our own lives. \\nit is the meaning that makes us cling hard on to life. \\nfor our love for this meaning is what makes us love life.\\n\\nit may be the case that my perception of my own self now which i believe has risen above moral standards, through my journey in philosophy and psychology, and has re-evaluated my values, would be entirely different than that of myself in nazi germany, or the soviet union. \\nthese selves being my own present self  adversarial selves: the ss officer, and a foot soldier of the soviet red army.\\n\\nit is  a pessimistic thought that i would have been an ss officer, or a foot soldier of the soviet red army wreaking havoc everywhere in every chance i get in my waking existence, for maybe majority of ordinary people now would have been those people who embodied the traits of the archetype of evil itself\\n\\nthere are the few exceptions however, the great individuals, the individuals who had the traits of what could be if not a great leader, for a great leader in my definition of it is the very individual who embodies the highest possible ideals of good.\\n\\nand so now my perception has changed that maybe ordinary men can become embodiments of the archetype of evil, men such as myself, and maybe my ideas of having the ideals good have a beginning…a genesis, in such ordinary men, may only be improbable, but not probable\\n\\nand somehow throughout history, there were still kinds of men who embodied these ideals of good, yet sadly they were only the few.\\n\\nleaders - philosophers, and the lot have sophisticated ideas than the ordinary individual, those who have built their morality from tough experiences.\\n\\nin times of chaos, and the deprivation of the basic needs of man, will the morals of man still stand. \\nor will it be feeble if not collapse in the face of catastrophe. \\nit is hard to admit to oneself that you would be such an individual who will drop their own moral compass even at the detriment of others, for one  own survival.\\n\\nthis ties in again to the idea of, if the world degenerates to chaos, will people uphold still the ideal of good, or will majority of the people compete to dominate by means of embracing the darkest and most savage recesses of their minds in order to do so?\\n\\nmutually taking care of each other in a monogamous relationship i believe is a form of expression of love. \\nbut what about children and parents, kind of a stupid question perhaps, but maybe children, us who were raised by our parents do not  give back that reciprocation to our parents — especially fathers. \\nwe as humans want love and appreciation too, and maybe we can show that love and appreciation too by finding ways in taking care of our parents the best we can once they have done their duty of raising us as functional members in society. \\ni do not  know, perhaps maybe i am asking too much of my future children, that i myself expect them to take care of me.\\n\\nmaybe i am  just afraid of not receiving that love back. \\nthe least i can do now is hope that at least my partner, reciprocate the actions of love i do.\\n\\ni was scared that sadness was a pit that one could never get out of. \\nthat was one of my main catalysts for discovering the idea of the crucible. \\nand so i devised a way how man could get himself out of such a predicament. \\ni wanted some idea to have a genesis in his mind that he can act out to get himself out of the pit of sadness and now i see that maybe sadness is an important emotion other than happiness, because sadness i believe now is vital in letting a person know that he or she needs to cry, sometimes we need to release our tears, but sometimes i know that we need to suppress it in times of danger that we may accomplish the task at hand. \\nbut at the same time, sometimes we do need this way of release that allows people to care for us when we are in such situations that made us sad in the first place. \\nwe all need someone to take care of us because it makes us and them feel connected more.\\n\\nthe problem is shaming men to show their emotions, and shaming men to not show their emotions. \\nwhy not give them the freedom to still be stoic in the face of their problems that they may solve it without having to be a slave to their emotions during such a time. \\nand also give them the space of safety that they may have the willingness to express themselves when they are hurting without being met with such harsh judgment.\\n\\nin times of danger we men must face it. but yet in the end of it, it is alright to shed one  own tears for not so tears are a hindrance to his potential.\\nwe men must be all.\\n\\nyou use your innate strengths that you already have which is maybe having a sense or humor, being really reserved, whatever that may be, and you capitalize on certain strengths amplify it such that you use it to your advantage.\\n\\nshould you lack innate strengths well maybe it is  better to build such skills overtime. \\nsometimes i think this is why people make this i think excuse of \"be yourself\" is because they have no skills, yet i would argue that they should have skills which interests them the most, that they may reinforce that belief of still being themselves. \\nfor is not  authentically picking a skill to build as your strength honesty to oneself and being oneself?\\n\\nit also keeps knocking on my mind whether my morals of selflessness and doing the little things for our family, friends, or partners is too much. \\na lot of people say do not  be too nice. \\nhow can you know when you are  being too nice? \\ndoes this niceness trump attractiveness? \\nwhat are quote unquote \"nice\" things that are not  really wrong at all? \\ni am  not a naturally selfish person, and every time i say no to things, or put myself first, i cannot help but feel guilty.\\n\\nwell i think for now the most feasible actions that can be done, when one feels they are too selfless is to have boundaries. \\nto pick out the things that can never be compromised.\\n\\nmaybe i judged this psychological writer robert greene too much for his book on manipulation tactics and getting power. \\ni have yet to find the ideal of ideal. \\nthe one individual who can rise above his instincts of succumbing to the corrupting force of power, even absolute power.\\n\\nbut i am  still put off by the fact that even if he says that there is an archetype that uses certain kinds of manipulation tactics, i want to not be incapable of doing what is unnatural to my own personality, i want to face it. \\nbecause it is the darkest, and most difficult dragon to face.\\n\\nwhy do we love our partner? \\nif we were in committed relationship and another came along who was the same as him/her but better why should we stay when there is someone better?\\n\\nif our partner is kind, why not love other people who are kind also? why this specific partner? why him/her only?\\n\\nwhen your significant other says things like \"you are  always and you will always…\" that is  a bad road to go to because you are immediately telling your partner they can never have the chance to change. \\nthat is  why when they do wrong things like that well of course you do not  hit each other but instead you tell your partner why it was wrong and what you can do to not do it again\\n\\nwell even as if though i was to be alive in a time where relationships, were only for children, or to build status, or just entirely for resources. \\nthe belief, my belief is that we all will still need someone at the end of the day, to love and care for us and for us to love and care for them back. \\nmarriages back then can seem superficial, but something integral as well, as something we all yearn for, as something human, all too human.\\n\\nsay god really did create an evil world just to make fun of you.\\n\\neverything you do will lead to your failings and he knows you will  fail yet he created you only for his own sake.\\n\\n\"my position was terrible. i knew that i could find nothing in the way of rational knowledge except a denial of life; and in faith i could find nothing except a denial of reason, and this was even more impossible than a denial of life. \\naccording to rational knowledge, it followed that life is evil, and people know it. \\nthey do not have to live, yet they have lived and they do live, just as i myself had lived, even though i had known for a long time that life is meaningless and evil. \\ntry as he might, tolstoy could identify only four means of escaping from such thoughts. \\none was retreating into childlike ignorance of the problem. \\nanother was pursuing mindless pleasure. \\nthe third was \"continuing to drag out a life that is evil and meaningless, knowing beforehand that nothing can come of it.\" \\n\\nhe identified that particular form of escape with weakness: \"the people in this category know that death is better than life, but they do not have the strength to act rationally and quickly put an end to the delusion by killing themselves….\" \\nonly the fourth and final mode of escape involved \"strength and energy. it consists of destroying life, once one has realized that life is evil and meaningless.\" \\ntolstoy relentlessly followed his thoughts: only unusually strong and logically consistent people act in this manner. \\nhaving realized all the stupidity of the joke that is being played on us and seeing that the blessings of the dead are greater than those of the living and that it is better not to exist, they act and put an end to this stupid joke; and they use any means of doing it: a rope around the neck, water, a knife in the heart, a train.\"\\n\\n— jordan b. peterson, 12 rules for life: an antidote to chaos\\n\\nso why bother with life i ask?\\nin the face of this cynicism. \\n\\nfaith in the impossible: it being that god is a benevolent being still does not  help, mainly because the fact that we hope this interpretation is good alleviates us of the difficulty of the temptation, that being the destruction of being/existence itself because god is merely only an evil entity who plays a stupid joke upon his own creation.\\n\\nall of it is god  fault anyway, is it not? \\nbesides the fact that he is the tragedy of existence he is also responsible for creating evil in the world because of the depraved species in turn gave life to.\\n\\nwhen you are  afraid of chaos you prepare for it, when working a job for the first time for example, you seek to find where they are located, when the interview will be, what the venue looks like, what are the stores and establishments inside the venue or building of your job. \\nbut what you need to hone is your aggression in turning order to chaos. \\nthat is for example: asking what building is this, what jobs are open in this building, when is the interview for this job, asking what to do for the interview?\\n\\ni may have gotten why people explode/snap angrily especially when they have  held it in for an indefinite amount of time. \\nbecause as soon as a wrong is being done to them and they do not  speak up and the other person who wronged them reverts to their good side, and another argument erupts, the other person is determined to use this as an opportunity, a reason to get back at the other persons unatoned sins.\\n\\nto be authentic i have said that to be honest with ourselves it must be never out of fear that we choose a specific choice, or out of convenience because we fear the other choices, or out of approval but more so with the choosing out of convenience we need to ask ourselves, is there a better choice that we gravitate to but the reason we avoid it is because of fear? if so and we fully gravitate to this choice, we need to be aggressive and charge through it courageously.\\n\\nthere is another dichotomy you have yet to reconcile. \\nand that is being honest with yourself, in not doing what others want you to do, because this is where tyranny is born. \\n\\nit gets confusing because with selflessness if it is  the right thing to do, you do it\\n\\nbut now i find myself asking the deeper question, do i want to do it or not?\\n\\nthis can carry in the workplace where tyranny can be prevalent. \\nbecause what if your boss tells you to get coffee for him, on the surface it is the right thing to do, and if you do not  your boss will get offended\\n\\nin others making you do the wrong thing that is easy to say no to. \\nbut what happens when it is right and others take advantage of your selflessness?\\n\\nwhere does the morality of selflessness draw the line?\\n\\nand what if you offend other people does not  that break your rule of not hurting others?\\n\\njordan peterson talked about chaos being symbolically associated with the feminine, and i do believe that such a notion is right, because of the fact that when men get rejected by women, it can be an indication to build and embody certain traits that will make men who were otherwise chosen, worthy of being in a woman  life, and therefore propagate their genetic material to the next generation biologically speaking.\\n\\nonto my insight, metaphorically speaking if chaos…that is where new forms or things emerge, and the feminine is that which either selects and/or rejects men. \\nnature a force of which that also selects is equivalent to the feminine.\\n\\nwhy chaos is symbolically associated with the feminine in a deeper sense is i believe because of the fact of course of the traditions of civilization that being the feminine being defined as the set of qualities that have been embodied by, acted out by, and associated with women\\n\\nbecause of the fact of course looking into the traditions of civilization the feminine are a set of traits and qualities that has been embodied and associated mainly by women (i say mainly because it has long been thought i believe that embodying the positive qualities of the opposite sex made one less of a man or woman for doing so)\\n\\nwe can look at the feminine which are the disembodied traits of women throughout civilization\\n\\ni believe it to be the reason why the feminine is associated symbolically with chaos, for of course looking into the traditions of civilization the feminine are a set of traits that has been embodied mainly by women and women are the representatives of the feminine \\n\\nbecause biologically women are the sex that primarily selects, now men can select too but that is if he has built himself and has embodied the necessary virtues needed to withstand the tragedy and malevolence of life so that he can also be a worthy individual of being in a woman  life and eventually raise children for they women after all are the more vulnerable sex physically speaking\\n\\nbiologically man is born out of their own wombs\\n\\npsychologically, new ideas can be adopted through the standards set by the feminine\\n\\nthen therefore, why it is associated with chaos is because of the fact that women select, and being rejected gives birth to new traits that can be used to be worthy of being in a woman  life\\n\\ni am  afraid people, individuals, need to know, have the willingness to open their eyes, that relationships are not always about you, are not always happiness, are not always fun, do not always promise the partner you hoped to be perfect, are not always built on love, do not always promise attraction all the time. \\nrelationships…it requires the morality of not hurting your partner no matter how angry you are, it requires voicing out your concerns in a calm and collected manner, it requires trust, vulnerability, and honesty, it requires work for attraction to last, it requires acceptance of our partners flaws, but it also requires the striving to better such flaws, it requires compromise of our standards instead of sacrificing altogether, but it requires sacrifice sometimes which in turn is selflessness, it requires security in order to be protected from the evils of the world which in turn requires responsibility\\n\\nit is  the small little things that our spouses do for us. \\nthe action itself entails that we are cared for and taken care of. \\na simple meal feeds us and satisfies us physically, but emotionally and spiritually, they satisfy us for weeks, months, years…a lifetime even.\\nyou can think deeply about it how you can hurt a relationship of another by being the one who the woman cheated with and indirectly hurting the man who was cheated on. \\nthe responsibility, it is placed on you, the man. we want to do it sure, but we must think of how it will affect others\\nand now we say this is evil and wrong and we should not  do it. \\nbut i would argue that the choice needs to exist in our realm, for we would be so frightened of our capability and confidence to do such a thing that we can easily choose the good\\nit is terrifying to know that even when we are with are loved ones, they cannot  fully know what goes on inside our heads. \\nbut being vulnerable is the best thing we can do to allow our loved ones to connect with us.\\ni do not  know, maybe after we have  done and paid for our dues, that is pay forward the price for living which is to embody to the best of our ability, our willingness to face our fear, endure pain, and discipline our own from being corrupted by the suffering if life, then yes maybe we can kill ourselves. \\nbecause what is there to live for if love for others and to be loved back does not exist, if human understanding and connection does not exist.\\n\\nthey are extensions of ourselves, our spouses, and we should treat them as such, like a flower that needs watering.\\n\\nto be vulnerable is to become one with this person, to know that he or she could hurt you with the knowledge they have known from you, anytime, and to have this connection through your vulnerability and theirs, results in both being one and as two way extensions of each other. \\ntherefore we should treat them as best and kindly as we can as such.\\n\\nyou have betrayed yourself why??? because you made a promise to yourself that every little thing you were going to do like completing every part of a workout or following a schedule was not followed through or delivered. \\nand it is  hard to trust you in completing anything.\\n\\nstick to your promises. \\nno matter how hard. \\nfor it will carry out in your relationships. \\nfor you will have the will to bear the burden, to carry the cross, of doing your best to never breaking their heart.\\n\\ntime waits for no man so be aggressive and take action even if you have to wait.\\n\\nand the beginnings for one can be that they are still young and afraid. \\nso it is  a natural instinct i believe to cower from, not speak up, and not stand up against higher status men. \\nbecause we ourselves are beneath them.\\n\\nbut i would argue it is  not about a heirarchy of you beneath then or then above you. \\nyou do the right thing. \\neven if you are a david against a goliath.\\n\\nimmobilize them with force physically if you have to, and do not  be afraid to lose.\\n\\nlearning in modern day evolutionary biology and evolutionary psychology, i have  learned more than i have  ever had than learning about this quote unquote \"red pill\" philosophy that has some of its axioms grounded in evolutionary biology and evolutionary psychology but some i believe has paid the cost of being detrimental ideologically injected pseudo science\\n\\napart from this i believe i can learn from this field not just in terms of what man  strategy in mating was, but how he thought in times adversity. \\nwhere in his lifetime lies the genesis of virtuous ideals.\\n\\nstarting off, men and women really are different because of their inherent biological differences in producing offspring. \\ngathering my own understanding of evolutionary psychology and biology, the difference stems from men being able to produce more offspring in a lifetime, and for women being unable to produce more offspring in a lifetime due to the long period of gestation of an offspring in her womb and thereafter the intensive care that a child needs in order to be raised, which implicitly highlights the long period to which a woman is vulnerable to threats of the outside world — evil for that matter. \\n\\nthis is why women are unbelievably selective, for if her limitation of vulnerability were not to exist during gestation then i believe she would have mated only for let  say romantic attraction for lack of a better word which of course involves, sex and love. \\nthey would argue that if this vulnerability is removed they can have the freedom of being sexually free like men. \\nand in this is where birth control comes. \\nsure you can have multiple sexual partners, and love them all, but it seems in reality such love is split between such partners and aside from this, because of birth control it encouraged promiscuity, and a high count of previous sexual partners.\\n\\nan argument can be made from the cynical and ever pessimistic \"red pill\" philosophy that a man cannot, mind you, be loved for who he is, not even for the money he has, but rather for the expedient fun and pleasure that can be attained through his money. \\ni then ask in an age where hedonism is all but otherwise discouraged or at least minimized, because money is fleeting, what then if the money has gone? \\nwould the relationship still stand firm?\\n\\ni however would be a fool to think that money or at least the ability to provide security for one  family or relationship is not needed. \\nit is i am  afraid but yet i strongly believe security is needed as an integral part of keeping a family or relationship together. \\nbearing the burden of financial instability is no easy weight to carry for a family and neither is coming back from it, and this is why i believe the fortitude of a man is to be tested, as well as the faithfulness of his partner or spouse\\n\\nbut where does too much money cross the line, where it becomes excessive, where it becomes solely for pursuit of impulsive, selfish, and hedonistic pleasure? \\ni have no metric still to say where the line is, but i do believe that there is a limit for how much an individual whether in a, or without relationship/s can be happy. \\nin my own anecdotal observations, i find that the happiness of an individual, does not increase particularly once they have already established an environment in which their needs of security are already met, and practically speaking, have kept them from being vulnerable from potential threats of the outside world and all its, let  say, evils. \\n\\nnietzsche wrote about the last man, and he/she is described as the individual that resigns from challenge of facing life head on, by gratifying impulsive desires — in other words, hedonism. \\nwhat was the solution to this you may ask, in my understanding of him as a great thinker, he rejected this notion of hedonism, for it entailed that suffering was to be avoided at all costs. \\nin response to this he thought that suffering is not something to be avoided but rather something to be confronted, and i believe he was right to think such a notion, for i believe, because of our irrationality, that yes man at the moment may cry for respite in a situation where he suffers greatly, yet as soon as his condition is, not lessened, but alleviated completely he seeks it yet again. \\n\"man, the bravest of animals, and the one most accustomed to suffering, does not repudiate suffering as such; he desires it, he even seeks it out, provided he is shown a meaning for it, a purpose of suffering\" — friedrich nietzsche, on the genealogy of morals. \\n\\nbut in spite of this choice, the choice of living a hedonistic fleeting life, i do believe that instead of such, it is by immersing ourselves, in the pursuit of, and in doing meaningful endeavors that sustains a relationship. \\nexcess money can be yes used for fun and pleasure and there is absolutely nothing wrong in having the desire for such things, but what happens if these pleasures start to dwindle, to dissipate, and therefore taken over by the mundane, the monotonous? \\nit is rather saddening and disheartening to believe and i do so also quite frankly, that relationships in this modern age of superficiality, fail, for the sole reason of the lack of pleasure. \\n\\nsuperficial things such as fame, money, and material possessions, are fleeting. happiness is fleeting, and it is precisely for this the reason i believe it to be the case that logotherapy as a tool can be used for relationships in the pit of boredom, that couples can find meaning in their relationship, a meaning that they too can share with each other, with their family and for mankind.\\n\\n\"a man never feels the loss of things which it never occurs to him to ask for; he is just as happy without them; whilst another, who may have a hundred times as much, feels miserable because he has not got the one thing he wants\" — arthur schopenhauer\\n\\nwhen one genuinely tries, when all turned his back on him, when all were indifferent to him, this produces the poison of resentment, and the poison of vengeance\\n\\nyet i would argue, yes they may have turned their backs on you, they may very well have been your enemies, due to the unfortunately unrequited love you showed them. \\nmaybe yes, you were wronged.\\n\\neven women for that matter; i was frightened by this question because such a question can lead to a much darker path. \\nthat is, why do we need to work for the approval of women or even men for that matter? \\nor even, why do people not love us as beings without anything, no positive personality whatsoever? \\n\\nit can get dark because once we do get in a relationship with someone, we say to ourselves in a cynical way that our partner only loves us for the personality we have  built and not who we were before, which were beings of nothingness — being of a blank slate for that matter\\n\\nit is indeed a cynical way of looking ourselves and the character and the personality we have  built for ourselves. how can i look at anyone or even myself for that matter, the same way again?\\n\\nmaybe we need to be good people.\\nmaybe we need to love ourselves, or even evil and individuals of no value for that matter.\\n\\nand you fail and fail and fail. \\nand maybe it is  ok to lay it at the feet of god, but maybe we need to change something ourselves in order to not to fail. \\ni admit that it is  been a long time since i have  denied this idea of changing ourselves because constant failure. \\n\\ni was scared of it, because let  say i have  done my due, i have  done everything i could do, and yet everything is still failing, i have  sacrificed everything we may think to ourselves. \\nmaybe i was just scared because of the work required in order to do so, to manifest the reality we want, which was once merely potential. \\n\\nmaybe i was just afraid of trying then failing, then trying again then failing again, then trying again then failing again, then changing or letting go what i am  doing wrong or even a part of myself for that matter which may in fact be undoubtedly painful.\\n\\nanother aspect of authenticity is of course when interacting with others you have already established how you talk authentically, which is to speak your mind, no matter how deep, or weird, or stupid\\n\\nbut actions that constitute a conversation, aside from speaking when asked to is how long you also think before coming up with something to say. \\nbeing able to be endure the silence while under the pressure of people waiting for you to say something because you are thinking is hard, but in order to be authentic, you must never care how long it takes for you to formulate an authentic statement. \\nyou must endure\\n\\ngod  intentions of tragedy is evil, this is the cynicism behind it, and to say the intentions behind it is good, is like saying evil people have intentions of good when they do evil things. \\nbut i disagree, because yes i am cynical about god  intentions of creating a universe like this. \\n\\nwe can acknowledge the evil intentions of humans even god for that matter, but what matters is how we move forward despite it. \\nand maybe this is where we turn the other cheek even when such people or even god wrongs us\\n\\nmaybe this is why prayer is practiced, because of this cynicism of god we can also wish for him to grant us our pleas our cry for help to do something good for us, to wish for him to stop, like how we can wish for evil people to stop, because yes they do evil things, but there is always a chance that they can do good, and that takes faith, that takes hope, to hope in something that is impossible.\\n\\nmaybe this finally bridges my unwillingness or perhaps my reluctance of fully praying to god, because i know he does evil things and maybe that is how it is. \\nand as i have  said why should i worship a god that does such horrible things for that matter? \\nand i said that it is our love for others that only trumps perhaps our hate for god, but still does not  fill the void of our reluctance to pray to such a god. \\nmaybe this can be the bridge to finally praying to god again and restoring our faith in humanity.\\n\\none technique to know if you are a visual thinker is. \\nwhile let  say you are thinking of something and you have for example written it down. \\nunconsciously you had something in your mind that led you to writing it down in paper. \\nrecall that memory and you will see the image or word if your someone who thinks in words once you know what image this is you can transfer it on paper to help people to see what you see, and let them translate the image into their own words, or see why your translation of the image into words is.\\n\\nwell i believe it now to be the case that polyamory can work given a specific situation, that is if all the people involved group themselves into a tribe, a family.\\n\\nwith enough introspection i began to see that maybe yes it is possible, for the only reason  i believe this mating strategy does not work if the people whom you are sharing your partner with you do not know and do not have a connection with. \\n\\nlet  put it this way, when we see a child crying what do we do, we say \"who  child is this\", but i imagine in a closely knitted tribe, when we see a child crying, we immediately comfort the child and take care of it as best we can\\n\\ni think its connection with each of the people in our tribe that lessens if not alleviates our jealousy when others mate with our mate.\\n\\nand somehow with this primal behavior i find myself, connecting spiritually to my ancestors even if i, this vessel is here in this present moment away physically from the likes of their species, but spiritually in front of them, and he in front of me, marveling at each other, at my past self, and he at his future self. \\nit is profound, and loving.\\n\\nbetrayal is when i visualize it is your spouse or partner throwing you from the highest heavens cliff down to hell, it is  not first person, but you get to witness your own fall from the ground, with red skies, and with hell and the dead waiting for you at the bottom to spread the disease of cynicism\\n\\npoint the finger to you as one of the great thinkers of my century jordan peterson says. \\nin a world where god is the architect of the suffering of the world, in a world where people treat you badly, there are as i have  always said multiple responses to this. \\n\\neither blame them, let your vengeance brew, and slake your thirst for vengeance, by killing everything god has created as a form of shaking your fist against him. \\nor you will yourself to the best of your ability to find a meaning to equalize your suffering, not to cause any more pain, not even to your enemies, but to take responsibility, to want to do good for the world, not to add more to the suffering, by being a part of the people who have caused you pain, but to be tough but also do good by others, for that is what they will need, like you have so yearned for, once.\\n\\nthe ideology of the \"red pill\" changes people it forces them to adapt yes to the sickness of society, but they perpetuate the cycle of sickness more and more, advocating for polygyny, unrealistic expectations, higher crime rates as an indirect result of single parent households, short term mating strategies, and machiavellian characteristics.\\n\\n\"if only it were all so simple! if only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. \\nbut the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. \\nand who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart?\" — aleksandr i. solzhenitsyn, the gulag archipelago.\\n\\nof course it is yet an undisputed truth as of the present, that danger exists in the world, predators exist in the world, those who seek to do evil exist in the world. \\ni can only dream of a world where evil all but exists, where we won\\'t need security, except of course for our own physiological needs.\\n\\nbut why is security in relationships even the prerequisite in order to be in one? \\naside from the fact that women are to be vulnerable during pregnancy. \\nhmm maybe security is also how you can protect your woman, \\n\\nbut what one needs to know is if it is  true that a woman looks for security first before the physical aspects, and personality aspects of man, the precise reason for why this is, is because of she is instinctually afraid of the potential predators of the environment she is in, not for other selfish reasons, and then i believe that is when she can fully be herself and be attracted to her man\\n\\nfor in maslow  hierarchy of needs security is the first thing, but i beg to iffer because i believe attraction is first, then because of reasons from a purely biological level we must protect ourselves from the threats of the outside world, if we are to keep this love going, not for the pathological reason of superficiality like wanting too much resources \\n\\nthen in order to be with each other both must work in order to be protected from the threats of the outside world as well as our own mortality\\n\\nmaslow  theory of mans needs states that the most basic needs of man is to have air, water, food, shelter, sleep, clothing, and reproduction to be able to survive. \\nakin to the concept of man  will to live of arthur schopenhauer, in which man is driven primarily in life by his will to satisfy his basic needs in order to live, i would beg to differ and argue however that the people who scramble in attaining these needs in order to survive are mostly unconscious of the fact that they have no answer to the singular most important question or at least to this singular most important question itself — why do we or i for that matter need to survive let alone live? \\n\\nsuch a notion implies that it is man …our, reason to live, the meaning that justifies the misery of our being…of our existence itself, that drives our will to live, which therefore puts meaning as the primary need for living, thus by definition fundamentally opposing maslow  theory that the primary needs of man were of the ones aforementioned. \\nfor after all what is the point of satisfying one  own basic needs, why bother trying to live at all, why bother dragging out oneself to continue living an existence where it itself is devoid of meaning and is filled with suffering? \\nsome people however continue to live, still unconscious of the fact that they lack the answer for justifying the misery of being. \\nthey do not have to live, yet they have lived, just as i myself have lived. \\nyet however even in the face of this terrible reality, meaning i believe can be found in the life we have in the present, we need only will ourselves to find this meaning, that we may use it as the great equalizer of the ever more present tragedy and malevolence lurking. \\n\"ever more people today have the means to live, but no meaning to live for\" — viktor frankl, man  search for meaning.\\n\\nwith the incessant cynicism the red pill pushes, of the \"selfish\" intentions of women, i believe it to be the case that these notions can be true in some cases because some people really do have bad intentions, but i believe women and men do have good intentions when it comes to relationships. \\nbiologically, evolutionarily, and psychologically speaking there are reasons why men and women need different things from each other, and one could say these are selfish reasons, but i believe, and call it a cliché concept, that love and connection could be the main driving force for relationships, and on top of that the responsibilities that come with it are secondary, and so when they say women only want you for your money, that is true yes, but for selfish reasons, i think not, i think they want money because that signals being able to take care of a family, when she will be put in a vulnerable position\\n\\nthere is a purely biological reason why people want what they want in a partner, but there is always the other side of the coin, which make people cynical of the intentions of people\\n\\nthe fundamental claim was the nazi  were afraid of the jews\\n\\njordan peterson: \"i was reading this book at the same time and it was just unbelievable how often hitler referred to the people he was eradicating; the slavs, the gypsies, and the jews, and all the people he went after as parasites and as rats and as insects and all of that\"\\n\\nhonestly speaking, people i believe would in a heartbeat agree that cockroaches or even more so mosquitoes are deplorable, disgusting, and useless, creatures, the scum of the earth, and no wonder, because mosquitoes unlike cockroaches at least are vile vermin that transmit harmful diseases, and extremely irritating and annoying bites that drive people mad.\\n\\nin my own anecdotal observations of my mind, psychologically speaking i have observed that instinctually the first response of the mind when faced with a creature more specifically a creature that one is disgusted at \\n\\nthrough the dehumanization process, you tend to see people differently, sure the hatred can be there but akin to when you see an insect, a cockroach perhaps, the first thought is to eradicate it completely, you may have no feelings resembling hate, but you just want to destroy it, because psychologically what is on your mind is that you are disgusted by this creature, and going back to people once you see people as this disgusting lowlife cretin of a creature, it can be dangerous how you treat them like the germans who had every reason to be resentful after ww1 when hitler came to power and said that these people were of other, and were disgusting lowlifes.\\n\\ni hypothesize, that instead of germans hating these people, they were disgusted by them, and thus began the horrors brought upon by the germans upon the jews, the gypsies, the mentally impaired, at that moment a person sees another person differently, the former can treat and see the latter differently, and maybe it is in the method of treating the latter, can atrocious actions be born.\\n\\nit has been a long-standing fear of mine, ever since i experienced firsthand, not even malevolence itself, but its potential, from a man that would come to change my life forever — the willingness or even perhaps the steadfastness to dominate, conquer, and crush my opponents not only in the game of basketball but in whatever discipline i was in. \\ni was afraid of their aggression when i myself showed first the steadfastness to dominate.\\n\\ni cannot understand it but a voice, the universe, the gods perhaps, tell me that i should from a jungian perspective integrate this characteristic of dominance into my self. \\nand maybe rightfully so, for after all i do believe that i and everyone ought to have the capability to be dominant but to keep such a capability sheathed at all times, when situations do not call for it. \\ni know not still the reason why i should dominate my opponents or enemies. \\ni am yet as of now uncertain why there is something particularly intrinsically better in the idea of an individual being a warrior in a garden rather than another individual being merely a gardener.\\n\\ndominance is basically being above the other, or rather being better than the other, and manifesting it into reality, by conquering your opponents in your own respective field.\\n\\nyet as of now i have no reason as to why i should dominate my opponents. \\nand like the virtues of courage, discipline, and endurance, maybe it is just the want to do these things that make us embody these virtues. \\nperhaps the only reason is to want to embody these virtues. \\nfor what would be the alternative?? \\nregret, anger, frustration? \\nyou are caught in two fears, the fear of not trying and of regret, and the fear of facing all your problems head on. \\nwe cannot  face both fears, because knowing that you are trying to get away from regret by facing your problems defines that thing you are getting away from you fear, so it kind of seems paradoxical. like the choices i have before written, man can take his own life, spite god, stay in his fear, stay undisciplined, and reduce pain, or face life head on.\\n\\nthe only reason i can think of to use this attribute of dominance, is in the situation of winning against the enemy, the devil, the tide of evil, and to crush him that we as warriors may be able to do what is right. \\nthis is one situation but we can also apply the same mindset and imagine our opponents as our goliaths and us as the righteous one  the davids, it sounds arrogant, but the reason for the former situation can spill over to latter situation.\\n\\ni have said that leaders are those which embody the ideals of man, that they can withstand the tragedy and malevolence of existence. \\nand maybe yes not too many people and not too many have in history and in the future will be able to withstand this great suffering without them being corrupted by it. \\nand maybe those, the leaders, will always be the adversary of the ones corrupted by suffering.\\n\\nit is actually a beautiful story quite frankly, the battle between good and evil, and i do feel and share the outmost sympathy to those who have given in to their worst instincts instead of becoming the hero, the great one, and the good one they could have destined to be\\n\\npractically speaking i think crying is not an unmanly or manly thing to do and its not an attractive nor unattractive thing either, but for me teaching this to what will be my future sons is important because i myself am an emotional person. \\nbut it needs to be laid down that when danger arises i myself and future generations of men as well must set aside emotions and face what is needed to be face at the moment. \\ni tell this to my younger friends all the time it is  ok to feel hurt it is  okay to cry and i will  be here to hold you when you are  hurting but when we are called to arms we ourselves must find the courage, discipline and endurance within ourselves to do what is needed to be done, and to face what is needed to be faced. \\nquite frankly being able to do this with my friends allows me to practice, that one day in the future i may be able to give compassion and encouragement to my sons and daughters in the most motherly and fatherly way\\n\\nthere is another thing you have to reconcile, that is to do the things you do not  want for the people you love, and what if it goes against your true self, what if it goes against your authentic self. \\nit is  an obligation for you to do it in order to keep them in your life. \\n\\neveryone in this bloody space seems to attack the notion of responsibility in a marriage or relationship. \\nit is  work. \\nit is  work to constantly love each other.\\n\\nyou do not  respect married men, why?? \\nbecause they provide love for their partner? \\nif he or she does not  reciprocate that is  not being a simp or whatever the fucking word you use, but that is  how you serve one another.\\n\\nand it is  always because of the cynical thoughts of these individuals specifically young men, that women by this time are used up and only want you for your money.\\n\\nnow i uncover that maybe marriage before which i thought was just a functional institution and a duty, was more than such. \\nand maybe my theory of one also connecting to another in ancient marriages was something also present and not just the functional use of procreation and passing on our knowledge and our legacy to the next generation\\n\\nit can be honestly dangerous once one comes to the realization that humanity itself is a species so reprehensible that it should just be eliminated. \\nbut how can one choose to fight against this evil? \\nwhat if genocide is committed just because of this realization? \\nhow can one perform this judgment without losing oneself, without falling into the abyss itself…without becoming the monster one sought to destroy? \\nthe same questions i have since the writing of the chapter, joker.\\n\\nhuman nature can be a spectrum that has two extremely polarized points one that is extremely hopeful and good and the other that is extremely dark and pessimistic.\\n\\nfor such an ideology like this which is rooted deeply in an extremely pessimistic school of thought it can be a corrupting force of the heart and can produce a thirst for vengeance that must be slaked at every waking moment\\n\\nand this i understand now, for part of the red pill stage is pitting one  own combatant belief system, and seeing yourself as the righteous one, which may or may not be necessarily right most of the time\\n\\nand even now i am battling this reprehensible of an ideology. \\nbut then i look to myself, and maybe i too have also succumbed to such an ideology. \\nthe ideology of the red pill which at times can be reprehensible at worst should be debated and battled through with ideas.\\n\\nin your understanding the jungian archetypes can be reduced to their individual traits. \\nyour virtues which are aggression, dominance, courage, discipline, endurance, honesty, presentfulness, limitlessness, as well as compassion, empathy, vulnerability.\\n\\nand certain combinations of these virtues seem to have formed countlessly thus creating an archetype and have echoed all throughout millennia in our history.\\n\\nand so with you and your childlikeness this is a manifestation of your honesty to oneself which is a manifestation as well of a form of courage, your aggression, courage, discipline, and endurance. \\na typical warrior archetype\\n\\nanother set of your virtues you have mentioned which are typically associated with the feminine that is understanding, compassion, selflessness, empathy, and vulnerability makes up i believe the lover archetype. \\nwhich can be unfortunately vulnerable to an individual man or woman who embody a negative hyper masculine archetype.\\n\\nand sometimes i think you become torn between your authentic self of being withdrawn or quiet as well as your other authentic self of expressing childlike wonder.\\n\\nand sometimes because of peer pressure us being our authentic selves can lead us to put on the act of being the pathological hyper masculine archetype and hurt the ones we give love and care for in an authentic way behind closed doors. \\nand finally that one friend we cared for because he/she himself/herself loses trust in us and moreover withdrawing from truly expressing themselves freely as a \"romantic\" or as their authentic selves\\n\\ni do have my own understanding of jordan peterson  notions of having the capability for evil but keeping such an evil at all times, sheathed, and only using it when necessary.\\n\\ni suspect that he has never i believe read kant  ideas of morality. \\nbecause my idea of integration in kant  sense is that if yes i do have the capability for evil, it then makes it better and more potent for my morality to be embodied/shown/manifested because choosing to do good instead of evil implies that there is a want to do good not out of necessity but out of our own volition, and our own freedom because of the evil path/choice being present in our realm of choices\\n\\nyou need to know how jordan peterson  notions of the shadow, can be weaponized for pathological masculinity, by people who want to embody a negative hyper masculine archetype, and not keeping it sheathed\\n\\neven if we have the high ground in our arguments morally or however it is, people generally do not  like swallowing the fact that they may have in fact lost the argument and even if they are in the wrong. \\nthey separate from the person acting out this moral arrogance. \\nbut this can be an axe in relationships. \\nand i do not  know yet as of now if it is the right thing to do but to try to win an argument and have the high ground maybe is not a good idea in keeping someone special in your life. \\nit is  not the fact they have  made a mistake, they know that all too well it is  how you threw it in their face that angered or hurt them.\\n\\ni can only think so much before it takes a toll on my mind. \\ni place my all in finding answers and sometimes it is difficult or maybe almost impossible to find it. \\nthe more answers i seem to answer the more questions i seem to have. but i will say this…the search for truth will not stop. \\ni need now to put my faith in my beliefs now even if another breaks my belief.'"
