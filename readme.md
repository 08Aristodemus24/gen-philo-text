**Problems:**
1. subclassing model giving different results to using Model API. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65851897/subclassing-of-model-class-and-model-functional-api-give-different-results-in-te. Could it be that using hte functional API is better than by using subclassing? What if all along I could've used the former in my previous recommender system project?
2. there is a reason why accuracy can be so low in generative text models, it's because other metrics like perplexity can be used to evaluate whether or not our models performs well. https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-evaluate-text-generation-models-metrics-for-automatic-evaluation-of-nlp-models-e1c251b04ec1
